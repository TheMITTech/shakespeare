<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>If fairings come thus plentifully in:</A><br>
<A NAME=3>A lady wall'd about with diamonds!</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Look you what I have from the loving king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Madame, came nothing else along with that?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme</A><br>
<A NAME=7>As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>That was the way to make his godhead wax,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>For he hath been five thousand years a boy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;</A><br>
<A NAME=15>And so she died: had she been light, like you,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,</A><br>
<A NAME=17>She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:</A><br>
<A NAME=18>And so may you; for a light heart lives long.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>A light condition in a beauty dark.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>We need more light to find your meaning out.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=22>You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>So do not you, for you are a light wench.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=26>Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=27>You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.</A><br>
<A NAME=30>But Rosaline, you have a favour too:</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Who sent it? and what is it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>I would you knew:</A><br>
<A NAME=33>An if my face were but as fair as yours,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>My favour were as great; be witness this.</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:</A><br>
<A NAME=36>The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>I were the fairest goddess on the ground:</A><br>
<A NAME=38>I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.</A><br>
<A NAME=39>O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Any thing like?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>Fair as a text B in a copy-book.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=44>'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>My red dominical, my golden letter:</A><br>
<A NAME=46>O, that your face were not so full of O's!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=48>But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=49>Madam, this glove.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=50>                  Did he not send you twain?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>Yes, madam, and moreover</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>A huge translation of hypocrisy,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>MARIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:</A><br>
<A NAME=56>The letter is too long by half a mile.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart</A><br>
<A NAME=58>The chain were longer and the letter short?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>MARIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>Ay, or I would these hands might never part.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.</A><br>
<A NAME=62>That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:</A><br>
<A NAME=63>O that I knew he were but in by the week!</A><br>
<A NAME=64>How I would make him fawn and beg and seek</A><br>
<A NAME=65>And wait the season and observe the times</A><br>
<A NAME=66>And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes</A><br>
<A NAME=67>And shape his service wholly to my hests</A><br>
<A NAME=68>And make him proud to make me proud that jests!</A><br>
<A NAME=69>So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state</A><br>
<A NAME=70>That he should be my fool and I his fate.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school</A><br>
<A NAME=74>And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>The blood of youth burns not with such excess</A><br>
<A NAME=76>As gravity's revolt to wantonness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>MARIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Folly in fools bears not so strong a note</A><br>
<A NAME=78>As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Since all the power thereof it doth apply</A><br>
<A NAME=80>To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BOYET</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>Thy news Boyet?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>                  Prepare, madam, prepare!</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=90>Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they</A><br>
<A NAME=91>That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>Under the cool shade of a sycamore</A><br>
<A NAME=93>I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;</A><br>
<A NAME=94>When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Toward that shade I might behold addrest</A><br>
<A NAME=96>The king and his companions: warily</A><br>
<A NAME=97>I stole into a neighbour thicket by,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>And overheard what you shall overhear,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>That, by and by, disguised they will be here.</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Their herald is a pretty knavish page,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Action and accent did they teach him there;</A><br>
<A NAME=103>'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And ever and anon they made a doubt</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Presence majestical would put him out,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'</A><br>
<A NAME=108>The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;</A><br>
<A NAME=109>I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'</A><br>
<A NAME=110>With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:</A><br>
<A NAME=112>One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore</A><br>
<A NAME=113>A better speech was never spoke before;</A><br>
<A NAME=114>Another, with his finger and his thumb,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'</A><br>
<A NAME=116>The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'</A><br>
<A NAME=117>The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.</A><br>
<A NAME=118>With that, they all did tumble on the ground,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>With such a zealous laughter, so profound,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>That in this spleen ridiculous appears,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=122>But what, but what, come they to visit us?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=123>They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;</A><br>
<A NAME=126>And every one his love-feat will advance</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Unto his several mistress, which they'll know</A><br>
<A NAME=128>By favours several which they did bestow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=130>For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=131>And not a man of them shall have the grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And then the king will court thee for his dear;</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,</A><br>
<A NAME=136>So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.</A><br>
<A NAME=137>And change your favours too; so shall your loves</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>But in this changing what is your intent?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:</A><br>
<A NAME=142>They do it but in mocking merriment;</A><br>
<A NAME=143>And mock for mock is only my intent.</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Their several counsels they unbosom shall</A><br>
<A NAME=145>To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Upon the next occasion that we meet,</A><br>
<A NAME=147>With visages displayed, to talk and greet.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=148>But shall we dance, if they desire to't?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech50><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=149>No, to the death, we will not move a foot;</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech51><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=152>Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>And quite divorce his memory from his part.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>PRINCESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=154>Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt</A><br>
<A NAME=155>The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out</A><br>
<A NAME=156>There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:</A><br>
<A NAME=158>So shall we stay, mocking intended game,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.</A><br>
<p><i>Trumpets sound within</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=160>The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.</A><br>
<p><i>The Ladies mask</i></p>
<p><i>Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,  BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits, and masked</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>MOTH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=161>All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=162>Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>MOTH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=163>A holy parcel of the fairest dames.</A><br>
<p><i>The Ladies turn their backs to him</i></p>
<A NAME=164>That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>BIRON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=165>[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech58><b>MOTH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=166>That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech59><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=167>True; out indeed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>MOTH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=168>Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe</A><br>
<A NAME=169>Not to behold--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>BIRON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=170>[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech62><b>MOTH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=171>Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=172>--with your sun-beamed eyes--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech63><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=173>They will not answer to that epithet;</A><br>
<A NAME=174>You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech64><b>MOTH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=175>They do not mark me, and that brings me out.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech65><b>BIRON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=176>Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!</A><br>
<p><i>Exit MOTH</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech66><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=177>What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:</A><br>
<A NAME=178>If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:</A><br>
<A NAME=179>That some plain man recount their purposes</A><br>
<A NAME=180>Know what they would.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech67><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=181>What would you with the princess?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech68><b>BIRON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=182>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech69><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=183>What would they, say they?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech70><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=184>Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech71><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=185>Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech72><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=186>She says, you have it, and you may be gone.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech73><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=187>Say to her, we have measured many miles</A><br>
<A NAME=188>To tread a measure with her on this grass.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech74><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=189>They say, that they have measured many a mile</A><br>
<A NAME=190>To tread a measure with you on this grass.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech75><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=191>It is not so. Ask them how many inches</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Is in one mile: if they have measured many,</A><br>
<A NAME=193>The measure then of one is easily told.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech76><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=194>If to come hither you have measured miles,</A><br>
<A NAME=195>And many miles, the princess bids you tell</A><br>
<A NAME=196>How many inches doth fill up one mile.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech77><b>BIRON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=197>Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech78><b>BOYET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=198>She hears herself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech79><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=199>                  How many weary steps,</A><br>
<A NAME=200>Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,</A><br>
<A NAME=201>Are number'd in the travel of one mile?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech80><b>BIRON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=202>We number nothing that we spend for you:</A><br>
<A NAME=203>Our duty is so rich, so infinite,</A><br>
<A NAME=204>That we may do it still without accompt.</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,</A><br>
<A NAME=206>That we, like savages, may worship it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech81><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=207>My face is but a moon, and clouded too.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech82><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=208>Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!</A><br>
<A NAME=209>Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,</A><br>
<A NAME=210>Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech83><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=211>O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;</A><br>
<A NAME=212>Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech84><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=213>Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.</A><br>
<A NAME=214>Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech85><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=215>Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.</A><br>
<p><i>Music plays</i></p>
<A NAME=216>Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech86><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=217>Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech87><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=218>You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech88><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=219>Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.</A><br>
<A NAME=220>The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech89><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=221>Our ears vouchsafe it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech90><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=222>But your legs should do it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech91><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=223>Since you are strangers and come here by chance,</A><br>
<A NAME=224>We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech92><b>FERDINAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=225>Why take we hands, then?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech93><b>ROSALINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
