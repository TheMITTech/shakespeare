<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, LORD HASTINGS, and others</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>What is this forest call'd?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth</A><br>
<A NAME=4>To know the numbers of our enemies.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>We have sent forth already.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>'Tis well done.</A><br>
<A NAME=7>My friends and brethren in these great affairs,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>I must acquaint you that I have received</A><br>
<A NAME=9>New-dated letters from Northumberland;</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Here doth he wish his person, with such powers</A><br>
<A NAME=12>As might hold sortance with his quality,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>The which he could not levy; whereupon</A><br>
<A NAME=14>He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers</A><br>
<A NAME=16>That your attempts may overlive the hazard</A><br>
<A NAME=17>And fearful melting of their opposite.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground</A><br>
<A NAME=19>And dash themselves to pieces.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>Now, what news?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>In goodly form comes on the enemy;</A><br>
<A NAME=23>And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>The just proportion that we gave them out</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Let us sway on and face them in the field.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=27>What well-appointed leader fronts us here?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter WESTMORELAND</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>Health and fair greeting from our general,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:</A><br>
<A NAME=32>What doth concern your coming?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>Then, my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Unto your grace do I in chief address</A><br>
<A NAME=35>The substance of my speech. If that rebellion</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Came like itself, in base and abject routs,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And countenanced by boys and beggary,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>In his true, native and most proper shape,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>You, reverend father, and these noble lords</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Had not been here, to dress the ugly form</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Of base and bloody insurrection</A><br>
<A NAME=44>With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Whose white investments figure innocence,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Your pens to lances and your tongue divine</A><br>
<A NAME=55>To a trumpet and a point of war?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>And with our surfeiting and wanton hours</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>And we must bleed for it; of which disease</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.</A><br>
<A NAME=62>But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>I take not on me here as a physician,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Nor do I as an enemy to peace</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Troop in the throngs of military men;</A><br>
<A NAME=66>But rather show awhile like fearful war,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>To diet rank minds sick of happiness</A><br>
<A NAME=68>And purge the obstructions which begin to stop</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.</A><br>
<A NAME=70>I have in equal balance justly weigh'd</A><br>
<A NAME=71>What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>And find our griefs heavier than our offences.</A><br>
<A NAME=73>We see which way the stream of time doth run,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>And are enforced from our most quiet there</A><br>
<A NAME=75>By the rough torrent of occasion;</A><br>
<A NAME=76>And have the summary of all our griefs,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>When time shall serve, to show in articles;</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>And might by no suit gain our audience:</A><br>
<A NAME=80>When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>We are denied access unto his person</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Even by those men that most have done us wrong.</A><br>
<A NAME=83>The dangers of the days but newly gone,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Whose memory is written on the earth</A><br>
<A NAME=85>With yet appearing blood, and the examples</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Of every minute's instance, present now,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Not to break peace or any branch of it,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>But to establish here a peace indeed,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Concurring both in name and quality.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>When ever yet was your appeal denied?</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Wherein have you been galled by the king?</A><br>
<A NAME=93>What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>That you should seal this lawless bloody book</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Of forged rebellion with a seal divine</A><br>
<A NAME=96>And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>My brother general, the commonwealth,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>To brother born an household cruelty,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>I make my quarrel in particular.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>There is no need of any such redress;</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Or if there were, it not belongs to you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>Why not to him in part, and to us all</A><br>
<A NAME=103>That feel the bruises of the days before,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And suffer the condition of these times</A><br>
<A NAME=105>To lay a heavy and unequal hand</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Upon our honours?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Construe the times to their necessities,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>And you shall say indeed, it is the time,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>And not the king, that doth you injuries.</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Yet for your part, it not appears to me</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Either from the king or in the present time</A><br>
<A NAME=113>That you should have an inch of any ground</A><br>
<A NAME=114>To build a grief on: were you not restored</A><br>
<A NAME=115>To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Your noble and right well remember'd father's?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>What thing, in honour, had my father lost,</A><br>
<A NAME=118>That need to be revived and breathed in me?</A><br>
<A NAME=119>The king that loved him, as the state stood then,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:</A><br>
<A NAME=121>And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Being mounted and both roused in their seats,</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel</A><br>
<A NAME=126>And the loud trumpet blowing them together,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd</A><br>
<A NAME=128>My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>O when the king did throw his warder down,</A><br>
<A NAME=130>His own life hung upon the staff he threw;</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Then threw he down himself and all their lives</A><br>
<A NAME=132>That by indictment and by dint of sword</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=134>You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.</A><br>
<A NAME=135>The Earl of Hereford was reputed then</A><br>
<A NAME=136>In England the most valiant gentlemen:</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?</A><br>
<A NAME=138>But if your father had been victor there,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:</A><br>
<A NAME=140>For all the country in a general voice</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on</A><br>
<A NAME=143>And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.</A><br>
<A NAME=144>But this is mere digression from my purpose.</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Here come I from our princely general</A><br>
<A NAME=146>To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace</A><br>
<A NAME=147>That he will give you audience; and wherein</A><br>
<A NAME=148>It shall appear that your demands are just,</A><br>
<A NAME=149>You shall enjoy them, every thing set off</A><br>
<A NAME=150>That might so much as think you enemies.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=151>But he hath forced us to compel this offer;</A><br>
<A NAME=152>And it proceeds from policy, not love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=153>Mowbray, you overween to take it so;</A><br>
<A NAME=154>This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:</A><br>
<A NAME=155>For, lo! within a ken our army lies,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>Upon mine honour, all too confident</A><br>
<A NAME=157>To give admittance to a thought of fear.</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Our battle is more full of names than yours,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>Our men more perfect in the use of arms,</A><br>
<A NAME=160>Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Then reason will our heart should be as good</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Say you not then our offer is compell'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=163>Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=164>That argues but the shame of your offence:</A><br>
<A NAME=165>A rotten case abides no handling.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=166>Hath the Prince John a full commission,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>In very ample virtue of his father,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>To hear and absolutely to determine</A><br>
<A NAME=169>Of what conditions we shall stand upon?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=170>That is intended in the general's name:</A><br>
<A NAME=171>I muse you make so slight a question.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=172>Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,</A><br>
<A NAME=173>For this contains our general grievances:</A><br>
<A NAME=174>Each several article herein redress'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=175>All members of our cause, both here and hence,</A><br>
<A NAME=176>That are insinew'd to this action,</A><br>
<A NAME=177>Acquitted by a true substantial form</A><br>
<A NAME=178>And present execution of our wills</A><br>
<A NAME=179>To us and to our purposes confined,</A><br>
<A NAME=180>We come within our awful banks again</A><br>
<A NAME=181>And knit our powers to the arm of peace.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=182>This will I show the general. Please you, lords,</A><br>
<A NAME=183>In sight of both our battles we may meet;</A><br>
<A NAME=184>And either end in peace, which God so frame!</A><br>
<A NAME=185>Or to the place of difference call the swords</A><br>
<A NAME=186>Which must decide it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=187>My lord, we will do so.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit WESTMORELAND</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=188>There is a thing within my bosom tells me</A><br>
<A NAME=189>That no conditions of our peace can stand.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=190>Fear you not that: if we can make our peace</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Upon such large terms and so absolute</A><br>
<A NAME=192>As our conditions shall consist upon,</A><br>
<A NAME=193>Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=194>Yea, but our valuation shall be such</A><br>
<A NAME=195>That every slight and false-derived cause,</A><br>
<A NAME=196>Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason</A><br>
<A NAME=197>Shall to the king taste of this action;</A><br>
<A NAME=198>That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,</A><br>
<A NAME=199>We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind</A><br>
<A NAME=200>That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff</A><br>
<A NAME=201>And good from bad find no partition.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=202>No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary</A><br>
<A NAME=203>Of dainty and such picking grievances:</A><br>
<A NAME=204>For he hath found to end one doubt by death</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Revives two greater in the heirs of life,</A><br>
<A NAME=206>And therefore will he wipe his tables clean</A><br>
<A NAME=207>And keep no tell-tale to his memory</A><br>
<A NAME=208>That may repeat and history his loss</A><br>
<A NAME=209>To new remembrance; for full well he knows</A><br>
<A NAME=210>He cannot so precisely weed this land</A><br>
<A NAME=211>As his misdoubts present occasion:</A><br>
<A NAME=212>His foes are so enrooted with his friends</A><br>
<A NAME=213>That, plucking to unfix an enemy,</A><br>
<A NAME=214>He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:</A><br>
<A NAME=215>So that this land, like an offensive wife</A><br>
<A NAME=216>That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,</A><br>
<A NAME=217>As he is striking, holds his infant up</A><br>
<A NAME=218>And hangs resolved correction in the arm</A><br>
<A NAME=219>That was uprear'd to execution.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=220>Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods</A><br>
<A NAME=221>On late offenders, that he now doth lack</A><br>
<A NAME=222>The very instruments of chastisement:</A><br>
<A NAME=223>So that his power, like to a fangless lion,</A><br>
<A NAME=224>May offer, but not hold.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=225>'Tis very true:</A><br>
<A NAME=226>And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,</A><br>
<A NAME=227>If we do now make our atonement well,</A><br>
<A NAME=228>Our peace will, like a broken limb united,</A><br>
<A NAME=229>Grow stronger for the breaking.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=230>Be it so.</A><br>
<A NAME=231>Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.</A><br>
<p><i>Re-enter WESTMORELAND</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>WESTMORELAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=232>The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship</A><br>
<A NAME=233>To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=234>Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=235>Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
