<H3>SCENE III. Warkworth. Before the castle.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Give even way unto my rough affairs:</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Put not you on the visage of the times</A><br>
<A NAME=4>And be like them to Percy troublesome.</A><br>
<A NAME=5>LADY</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>I have given over, I will speak no more:</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;</A><br>
<A NAME=9>And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>LADY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!</A><br>
<A NAME=11>The time was, father, that you broke your word,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>When you were more endeared to it than now;</A><br>
<A NAME=13>When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Threw many a northward look to see his father</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Who then persuaded you to stay at home?</A><br>
<A NAME=17>There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.</A><br>
<A NAME=18>For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!</A><br>
<A NAME=19>For his, it stuck upon him as the sun</A><br>
<A NAME=20>In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Did all the chivalry of England move</A><br>
<A NAME=22>To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:</A><br>
<A NAME=24>He had no legs that practised not his gait;</A><br>
<A NAME=25>And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Became the accents of the valiant;</A><br>
<A NAME=27>For those that could speak low and tardily</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Would turn their own perfection to abuse,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>In diet, in affections of delight,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>In military rules, humours of blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>He was the mark and glass, copy and book,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!</A><br>
<A NAME=34>O miracle of men! him did you leave,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Second to none, unseconded by you,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>To look upon the hideous god of war</A><br>
<A NAME=37>In disadvantage; to abide a field</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Did seem defensible: so you left him.</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong</A><br>
<A NAME=41>To hold your honour more precise and nice</A><br>
<A NAME=42>With others than with him! let them alone:</A><br>
<A NAME=43>The marshal and the archbishop are strong:</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>Beshrew your heart,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me</A><br>
<A NAME=49>With new lamenting ancient oversights.</A><br>
<A NAME=50>But I must go and meet with danger there,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Or it will seek me in another place</A><br>
<A NAME=52>And find me worse provided.</A><br>
<A NAME=53>LADY</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>O, fly to Scotland,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Till that the nobles and the armed commons</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Have of their puissance made a little taste.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>LADY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>If they get ground and vantage of the king,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>First let them try themselves. So did your son;</A><br>
<A NAME=61>He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And never shall have length of life enough</A><br>
<A NAME=63>To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>For recordation to my noble husband.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind</A><br>
<A NAME=67>As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>That makes a still-stand, running neither way:</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>But many thousand reasons hold me back.</A><br>
<A NAME=71>I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Till time and vantage crave my company.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
