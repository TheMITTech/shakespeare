<H3>SCENE III. York. The Archbishop's palace.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS, MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;</A><br>
<A NAME=2>And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>I well allow the occasion of our arms;</A><br>
<A NAME=6>But gladly would be better satisfied</A><br>
<A NAME=7>How in our means we should advance ourselves</A><br>
<A NAME=8>To look with forehead bold and big enough</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Upon the power and puissance of the king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>Our present musters grow upon the file</A><br>
<A NAME=11>To five and twenty thousand men of choice;</A><br>
<A NAME=12>And our supplies live largely in the hope</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns</A><br>
<A NAME=14>With an incensed fire of injuries.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Whether our present five and twenty thousand</A><br>
<A NAME=17>May hold up head without Northumberland?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>With him, we may.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>                  Yea, marry, there's the point:</A><br>
<A NAME=20>But if without him we be thought too feeble,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>My judgment is, we should not step too far</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Till we had his assistance by the hand;</A><br>
<A NAME=23>For in a theme so bloody-faced as this</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Conjecture, expectation, and surmise</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Of aids incertain should not be admitted.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=26>'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed</A><br>
<A NAME=27>It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Eating the air on promise of supply,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Flattering himself in project of a power</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:</A><br>
<A NAME=32>And so, with great imagination</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Proper to madmen, led his powers to death</A><br>
<A NAME=34>And winking leap'd into destruction.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=35>But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt</A><br>
<A NAME=36>To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>Yes, if this present quality of war,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Lives so in hope as in an early spring</A><br>
<A NAME=40>We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Hope gives not so much warrant as despair</A><br>
<A NAME=42>That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>We first survey the plot, then draw the model;</A><br>
<A NAME=44>And when we see the figure of the house,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Then must we rate the cost of the erection;</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Which if we find outweighs ability,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>What do we then but draw anew the model</A><br>
<A NAME=48>In fewer offices, or at last desist</A><br>
<A NAME=49>To build at all? Much more, in this great work,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And set another up, should we survey</A><br>
<A NAME=52>The plot of situation and the model,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Consent upon a sure foundation,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Question surveyors, know our own estate,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>How able such a work to undergo,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>To weigh against his opposite; or else</A><br>
<A NAME=57>We fortify in paper and in figures,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Using the names of men instead of men:</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Like one that draws the model of a house</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost</A><br>
<A NAME=62>A naked subject to the weeping clouds</A><br>
<A NAME=63>And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd</A><br>
<A NAME=66>The utmost man of expectation,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>I think we are a body strong enough,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Even as we are, to equal with the king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.</A><br>
<A NAME=71>For his divisions, as the times do brawl,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Are in three heads: one power against the French,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>And one against Glendower; perforce a third</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Must take up us: so is the unfirm king</A><br>
<A NAME=75>In three divided; and his coffers sound</A><br>
<A NAME=76>With hollow poverty and emptiness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>That he should draw his several strengths together</A><br>
<A NAME=78>And come against us in full puissance,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Need not be dreaded.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>If he should do so,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Baying him at the heels: never fear that.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>Who is it like should lead his forces hither?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:</A><br>
<A NAME=86>But who is substituted 'gainst the French,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>I have no certain notice.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ARCHBISHOP OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>Let us on,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>And publish the occasion of our arms.</A><br>
<A NAME=90>The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:</A><br>
<A NAME=92>An habitation giddy and unsure</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.</A><br>
<A NAME=94>O thou fond many, with what loud applause</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!</A><br>
<A NAME=97>And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.</A><br>
<A NAME=100>So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;</A><br>
<A NAME=102>And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>And howl'st to find it. What trust is in</A><br>
<A NAME=104>these times?</A><br>
<A NAME=105>They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Are now become enamour'd on his grave:</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head</A><br>
<A NAME=108>When through proud London he came sighing on</A><br>
<A NAME=109>After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Past and to come seems best; things present worst.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>MOWBRAY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.</A><br>
