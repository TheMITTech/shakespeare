<A NAME=speech9><b>QUEEN KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;</A><br>
<A NAME=14>And to bestow your pity on me: for</A><br>
<A NAME=15>I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Born out of your dominions; having here</A><br>
<A NAME=17>No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>In what have I offended you? what cause</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>That thus you should proceed to put me off,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>I have been to you a true and humble wife,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>At all times to your will conformable;</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry</A><br>
<A NAME=27>As I saw it inclined: when was the hour</A><br>
<A NAME=28>I ever contradicted your desire,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Have I not strove to love, although I knew</A><br>
<A NAME=31>He were mine enemy? what friend of mine</A><br>
<A NAME=32>That had to him derived your anger, did I</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice</A><br>
<A NAME=34>He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind</A><br>
<A NAME=35>That I have been your wife, in this obedience,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Upward of twenty years, and have been blest</A><br>
<A NAME=37>With many children by you: if, in the course</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And process of this time, you can report,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>And prove it too, against mine honour aught,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Against your sacred person, in God's name,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Shut door upon me, and so give me up</A><br>
<A NAME=44>To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>The king, your father, was reputed for</A><br>
<A NAME=46>A prince most prudent, of an excellent</A><br>
<A NAME=47>And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one</A><br>
<A NAME=49>The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many</A><br>
<A NAME=50>A year before: it is not to be question'd</A><br>
<A NAME=51>That they had gather'd a wise council to them</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Of every realm, that did debate this business,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel</A><br>
<A NAME=56>I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,</A><br>

<A NAME=77>The daughter of a king, my drops of tears</A><br>
<A NAME=78>I'll turn to sparks of fire.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>CARDINAL WOLSEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>Be patient yet.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>QUEEN KATHARINE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>I will, when you are humble; nay, before,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Or God will punish me. I do believe,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Induced by potent circumstances, that</A><br>
<A NAME=83>You are mine enemy, and make my challenge</A><br>
<A NAME=84>You shall not be my judge: for it is you</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>I hold my most malicious foe, and think not</A><br>
<A NAME=90>At all a friend to truth.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>CARDINAL WOLSEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>I do profess</A><br>
<A NAME=92>You speak not like yourself; who ever yet</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects</A><br>
<A NAME=94>Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom</A><br>
<A NAME=95>O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:</A><br>
<A NAME=96>I have no spleen against you; nor injustice</A><br>
<A NAME=97>For you or any: how far I have proceeded,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Or how far further shall, is warranted</A><br>
<A NAME=99>By a commission from the consistory,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me</A><br>
<A NAME=101>That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:</A><br>
<A NAME=102>The king is present: if it be known to him</A><br>
<A NAME=103>That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much</A><br>
<A NAME=105>As you have done my truth. If he know</A><br>
<A NAME=106>That I am free of your report, he knows</A><br>
<A NAME=107>I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him</A><br>
<A NAME=108>It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Remove these thoughts from you: the which before</A><br>
<A NAME=110>His highness shall speak in, I do beseech</A><br>
<A NAME=111>You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking</A><br>
<A NAME=112>And to say so no more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>My lord, my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>I am a simple woman, much too weak</A><br>
<A NAME=115>To oppose your cunning. You're meek and</A><br>
<A NAME=116>humble-mouth'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=117>You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,</A><br>
<A NAME=118>With meekness and humility; but your heart</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.</A><br>
<A NAME=120>You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Where powers are your retainers, and your words,</A><br>

<A NAME=124>Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,</A><br>
<A NAME=125>You tender more your person's honour than</A><br>
<A NAME=126>Your high profession spiritual: that again</A><br>
<A NAME=127>I do refuse you for my judge; and here,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Before you all, appeal unto the pope,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,</A><br>

<A NAME=134>She's going away.</A><br>

<A NAME=159>There must I be unloosed, although not there</A><br>
<A NAME=160>At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Did broach this business to your highness; or</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Laid any scruple in your way, which might</A><br>
<A NAME=163>Induce you to the question on't? or ever</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Have to you, but with thanks to God for such</A><br>
<A NAME=165>A royal lady, spake one the least word that might</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Be to the prejudice of her present state,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>Or touch of her good person?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=168>My lord cardinal,</A><br>
<A NAME=169>I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,</A><br>
<A NAME=170>I free you from't. You are not to be taught</A><br>
<A NAME=171>That you have many enemies, that know not</A><br>
<A NAME=172>Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,</A><br>
<A NAME=173>Bark when their fellows do: by some of these</A><br>
<A NAME=174>The queen is put in anger. You're excused:</A><br>
<A NAME=175>But will you be more justified? You ever</A><br>
<A NAME=176>Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired</A><br>
<A NAME=177>It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,</A><br>
<A NAME=178>The passages made toward it: on my honour,</A><br>
<A NAME=179>I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,</A><br>
<A NAME=180>And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,</A><br>
<A NAME=181>I will be bold with time and your attention:</A><br>
<A NAME=182>Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:</A><br>
<A NAME=183>My conscience first received a tenderness,</A><br>
<A NAME=184>Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd</A><br>
<A NAME=185>By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;</A><br>
<A NAME=186>Who had been hither sent on the debating</A><br>
<A NAME=187>A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and</A><br>
<A NAME=188>Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,</A><br>
<A NAME=189>Ere a determinate resolution, he,</A><br>
<A NAME=190>I mean the bishop, did require a respite;</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Wherein he might the king his lord advertise</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Whether our daughter were legitimate,</A><br>
<A NAME=193>Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,</A><br>
<A NAME=194>Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook</A><br>
<A NAME=195>The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,</A><br>
<A NAME=196>Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble</A><br>
<A NAME=197>The region of my breast; which forced such way,</A><br>
<A NAME=198>That many mazed considerings did throng</A><br>
<A NAME=199>And press'd in with this caution. First, methought</A><br>
<A NAME=200>I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had</A><br>
<A NAME=201>Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,</A><br>
<A NAME=202>If it conceived a male child by me, should</A><br>
<A NAME=203>Do no more offices of life to't than</A><br>
<A NAME=204>The grave does to the dead; for her male issue</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Or died where they were made, or shortly after</A><br>
<A NAME=206>This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,</A><br>
<A NAME=207>This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,</A><br>
<A NAME=208>Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not</A><br>
<A NAME=209>Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that</A><br>
<A NAME=210>I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in</A><br>
<A NAME=211>By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me</A><br>
<A NAME=212>Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in</A><br>
<A NAME=213>The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer</A><br>
<A NAME=214>Toward this remedy, whereupon we are</A><br>
<A NAME=215>Now present here together: that's to say,</A><br>
<A NAME=216>I meant to rectify my conscience,--which</A><br>
<A NAME=217>I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--</A><br>
<A NAME=218>By all the reverend fathers of the land</A><br>
<A NAME=219>And doctors learn'd: first I began in private</A><br>
<A NAME=220>With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember</A><br>
<A NAME=221>How under my oppression I did reek,</A><br>
<A NAME=222>When I first moved you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>LINCOLN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=223>Very well, my liege.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=224>I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say</A><br>
<A NAME=225>How far you satisfied me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>LINCOLN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=226>So please your highness,</A><br>
<A NAME=227>The question did at first so stagger me,</A><br>
<A NAME=228>Bearing a state of mighty moment in't</A><br>
<A NAME=229>And consequence of dread, that I committed</A><br>
<A NAME=230>The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;</A><br>
<A NAME=231>And did entreat your highness to this course</A><br>
<A NAME=232>Which you are running here.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=233>I then moved you,</A><br>

<A NAME=235>To make this present summons: unsolicited</A><br>
<A NAME=236>I left no reverend person in this court;</A><br>
<A NAME=237>But by particular consent proceeded</A><br>
<A NAME=238>Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:</A><br>
<A NAME=239>For no dislike i' the world against the person</A><br>
<A NAME=240>Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points</A><br>
<A NAME=241>Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:</A><br>
<A NAME=242>Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life</A><br>
<A NAME=243>And kingly dignity, we are contented</A><br>
<A NAME=244>To wear our mortal state to come with her,</A><br>
<A NAME=245>Katharine our queen, before the primest creature</A><br>
<A NAME=246>That's paragon'd o' the world.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>CARDINAL CAMPEIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=247>So please your highness,</A><br>
<A NAME=248>The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness</A><br>

<A NAME=251>Made to the queen, to call back her appeal</A><br>
<A NAME=252>She intends unto his holiness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>
