<H3>SCENE I. Westminster. A street.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter two Gentlemen, meeting</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Whither away so fast?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>O, God save ye!</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Even to the hall, to hear what shall become</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Of the great Duke of Buckingham.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>I'll save you</A><br>
<A NAME=6>That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Of bringing back the prisoner.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Were you there?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>Yes, indeed, was I.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>Pray, speak what has happen'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>You may guess quickly what.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>Is he found guilty?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>I am sorry for't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>                  So are a number more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=16>But, pray, how pass'd it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>I'll tell you in a little. The great duke</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Came to the bar; where to his accusations</A><br>
<A NAME=19>He pleaded still not guilty and alleged</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.</A><br>
<A NAME=21>The king's attorney on the contrary</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired</A><br>
<A NAME=24>To have brought viva voce to his face:</A><br>
<A NAME=25>At which appear'd against him his surveyor;</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Hopkins, that made this mischief.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>That was he</A><br>
<A NAME=30>That fed him with his prophecies?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>The same.</A><br>
<A NAME=32>All these accused him strongly; which he fain</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:</A><br>
<A NAME=34>And so his peers, upon this evidence,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Have found him guilty of high treason. Much</A><br>
<A NAME=36>He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Was either pitied in him or forgotten.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>After all this, how did he bear himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>When he was brought again to the bar, to hear</A><br>
<A NAME=40>His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd</A><br>
<A NAME=41>With such an agony, he sweat extremely,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:</A><br>
<A NAME=43>But he fell to himself again, and sweetly</A><br>
<A NAME=44>In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=45>I do not think he fears death.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>Sure, he does not:</A><br>
<A NAME=47>He never was so womanish; the cause</A><br>
<A NAME=48>He may a little grieve at.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=49>Certainly</A><br>
<A NAME=50>The cardinal is the end of this.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>'Tis likely,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Lest he should help his father.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>That trick of state</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Was a deep envious one.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>At his return</A><br>
<A NAME=59>No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>And generally, whoever the king favours,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>The cardinal instantly will find employment,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And far enough from court too.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>All the commons</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much</A><br>
<A NAME=66>They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>The mirror of all courtesy;--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Stay there, sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves  before him; the axe with the edge towards him;  halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL, VAUX, SANDS, and common people</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>Let's stand close, and behold him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>All good people,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>You that thus far have come to pity me,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.</A><br>
<A NAME=74>I have this day received a traitor's judgment,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>And if I have a co nscience, let it sink me,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!</A><br>
<A NAME=78>The law I bear no malice for my death;</A><br>
<A NAME=79>'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:</A><br>
<A NAME=80>But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;</A><br>
<A NAME=84>For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.</A><br>
<A NAME=85>For further life in this world I ne'er hope,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies</A><br>
<A NAME=87>More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Is only bitter to him, only dying,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Go with me, like good angels, to my end;</A><br>
<A NAME=92>And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>LOVELL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>I do beseech your grace, for charity,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>If ever any malice in your heart</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you</A><br>
<A NAME=99>As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;</A><br>
<A NAME=100>There cannot be those numberless offences</A><br>
<A NAME=101>'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:</A><br>
<A NAME=102>no black envy</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him</A><br>
<A NAME=105>You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Longer than I have time to tell his years!</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!</A><br>
<A NAME=110>And when old time shall lead him to his end,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Goodness and he fill up one monument!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>LOVELL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=112>To the water side I must conduct your grace;</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>Who undertakes you to your end.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>VAUX</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=115>Prepare there,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;</A><br>
<A NAME=117>And fit it with such furniture as suits</A><br>
<A NAME=118>The greatness of his person.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>Nay, Sir Nicholas,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.</A><br>
<A NAME=121>When I came hither, I was lord high constable</A><br>
<A NAME=122>And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Yet I am richer than my base accusers,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;</A><br>
<A NAME=125>And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.</A><br>
<A NAME=126>My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Who first raised head against usurping Richard,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Flying for succor to his servant Banister,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=130>And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying</A><br>
<A NAME=132>My father's loss, like a most royal prince,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Made my name once more noble. Now his son,</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all</A><br>
<A NAME=136>That made me happy at one stroke has taken</A><br>
<A NAME=137>For ever from the world. I had my trial,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>A little happier than my wretched father:</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;</A><br>
<A NAME=142>A most unnatural and faithless service!</A><br>
<A NAME=143>Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>This from a dying man receive as certain:</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends</A><br>
<A NAME=147>And give your hearts to, when they once perceive</A><br>
<A NAME=148>The least rub in your fortunes, fall away</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Like water from ye, never found again</A><br>
<A NAME=150>But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:</A><br>
<A NAME=153>And when you would say something that is sad,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=155>O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>I fear, too many curses on their beads</A><br>
<A NAME=157>That were the authors.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=158>If the duke be guiltless,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling</A><br>
<A NAME=160>Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Greater than this.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=162>                  Good angels keep it from us!</A><br>
<A NAME=163>What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=164>This secret is so weighty, 'twill require</A><br>
<A NAME=165>A strong faith to conceal it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=166>Let me have it;</A><br>
<A NAME=167>I do not talk much.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=168>I am confident,</A><br>
<A NAME=169>You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear</A><br>
<A NAME=170>A buzzing of a separation</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Between the king and Katharine?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=172>Yes, but it held not:</A><br>
<A NAME=173>For when the king once heard it, out of anger</A><br>
<A NAME=174>He sent command to the lord mayor straight</A><br>
<A NAME=175>To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues</A><br>
<A NAME=176>That durst disperse it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=177>But that slander, sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=178>Is found a truth now: for it grows again</A><br>
<A NAME=179>Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain</A><br>
<A NAME=180>The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,</A><br>
<A NAME=181>Or some about him near, have, out of malice</A><br>
<A NAME=182>To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple</A><br>
<A NAME=183>That will undo her: to confirm this too,</A><br>
<A NAME=184>Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;</A><br>
<A NAME=185>As all think, for this business.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=186>'Tis the cardinal;</A><br>
<A NAME=187>And merely to revenge him on the emperor</A><br>
<A NAME=188>For not bestowing on him, at his asking,</A><br>
<A NAME=189>The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=190>I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel</A><br>
<A NAME=191>That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Will have his will, and she must fall.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=193>'Tis woful.</A><br>
<A NAME=194>We are too open here to argue this;</A><br>
<A NAME=195>Let's think in private more.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
