<A NAME=2>life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty</A><br>
<A NAME=3>princess of England, Elizabeth!</A><br>
<p><i>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard</i></p>

<A NAME=4>[Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:</A><br>
<A NAME=6>All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>May hourly fall upon ye!</A><br>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>Thank you, good lord archbishop:</A><br>
<A NAME=10>What is her name?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>CRANMER</b></a>

<A NAME=16>My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:</A><br>
<A NAME=17>I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>When she has so much English.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>CRANMER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>Let me speak, sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.</A><br>
<A NAME=22>This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Though in her cradle, yet now promises</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--</A><br>
<A NAME=26>But few now living can behold that goodness--</A><br>
<A NAME=27>A pattern to all princes living with her,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And all that shall succeed: Saba was never</A><br>
<A NAME=29>More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>With all the virtues that attend the good,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:</A><br>
<A NAME=35>She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:</A><br>
<A NAME=38>In her days every man shall eat in safety,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing</A><br>
<A NAME=40>The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:</A><br>
<A NAME=41>God shall be truly known; and those about her</A><br>
<A NAME=42>From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when</A><br>
<A NAME=45>The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Her ashes new create another heir,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>As great in admiration as herself;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>So shall she leave her blessedness to one,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Who from the sacred ashes of her honour</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>That were the servants to this chosen infant,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>His honour and the greatness of his name</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches</A><br>
<A NAME=59>To all the plains about him: our children's children</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Shall see this, and bless heaven.</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>CRANMER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>She shall be, to the happiness of England,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>An aged princess; many days shall see her,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>And yet no day without a deed to crown it.</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Would I had known no more! but she must die,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>A most unspotted lily shall she pass</A><br>
<A NAME=68>To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>KING HENRY VIII</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>O lord archbishop,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Thou hast made me now a man! never, before</A><br>
<A NAME=71>This happy child, did I get any thing:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>That when I am in heaven I shall desire</A><br>
<A NAME=74>To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.</A><br>
<A NAME=75>I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>And your good brethren, I am much beholding;</A><br>
<A NAME=77>I have received much honour by your presence,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>She will be sick else. This day, no man think</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Has business at his house; for all shall stay:</A><br>
<A NAME=82>This little one shall make it holiday.</A><br>

<A NAME=83>EPILOGUE</A><br>
<A NAME=84>'Tis ten to one this play can never please</A><br>
<A NAME=85>All that are here: some come to take their ease,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>All the expected good we're like to hear</A><br>
<A NAME=92>For this play at this time, is only in</A><br>
<A NAME=93>The merciful construction of good women;</A><br>
<A NAME=94>For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>And say 'twill do, I know, within a while</A><br>
<A NAME=96>All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.</A><br>
