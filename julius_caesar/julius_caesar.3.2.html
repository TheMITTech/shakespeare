<i>Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens</i>

<A NAME=speech2><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Cassius, go you into the other street,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>And part the numbers.</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;</A><br>
<A NAME=7>And public reasons shall be rendered</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Of Caesar's death.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Second Citizen</b></a>

<A NAME=10>I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>When severally we hear them rendered.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS goes into the pulpit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>Third Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>Be patient till the last.</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my</A><br>
<A NAME=15>cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me</A><br>
<A NAME=16>for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that</A><br>
<A NAME=17>you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and</A><br>
<A NAME=18>awake your senses, that you may the better judge.</A><br>
<A NAME=19>If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar</A><br>
<A NAME=21>was no less than his. If then that friend demand</A><br>
<A NAME=22>why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:</A><br>
<A NAME=23>--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and</A><br>
<A NAME=25>die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live</A><br>
<A NAME=26>all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;</A><br>
<A NAME=27>as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was</A><br>
<A NAME=28>valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I</A><br>
<A NAME=29>slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his</A><br>
<A NAME=30>fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his</A><br>
<A NAME=31>ambition. Who is here so base that would be a</A><br>
<A NAME=32>bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If</A><br>
<A NAME=34>any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so</A><br>
<A NAME=35>vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;</A><br>
<A NAME=36>for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>All</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>None, Brutus, none.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>Then none have I offended. I have done no more to</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of</A><br>
<A NAME=40>his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not</A><br>
<A NAME=41>extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences</A><br>
<A NAME=42>enforced, for which he suffered death.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body</i></p>
<A NAME=43>Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>though he had no hand in his death, shall receive</A><br>
<A NAME=45>the benefit of his dying, a place in the</A><br>
<A NAME=46>commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this</A><br>
<A NAME=47>I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the</A><br>
<A NAME=48>good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>when it shall please my country to need my death.</A><br>

<A NAME=65>By our permission, is allow'd to make.</A><br>
<A NAME=66>I do entreat you, not a man depart,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.</A><br>

<A NAME=76>This Caesar was a tyrant.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>Third Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Nay, that's certain:</A><br>
<A NAME=78>We are blest that Rome is rid of him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>Second Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>You gentle Romans,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>Citizens</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Peace, ho! let us hear him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;</A><br>
<A NAME=83>I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.</A><br>
<A NAME=84>The evil that men do lives after them;</A><br>
<A NAME=85>The good is oft interred with their bones;</A><br>
<A NAME=86>So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:</A><br>
<A NAME=88>If it were so, it was a grievous fault,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--</A><br>
<A NAME=91>For Brutus is an honourable man;</A><br>
<A NAME=92>So are they all, all honourable men--</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.</A><br>
<A NAME=94>He was my friend, faithful and just to me:</A><br>
<A NAME=95>But Brutus says he was ambitious;</A><br>
<A NAME=96>And Brutus is an honourable man.</A><br>
<A NAME=97>He hath brought many captives home to Rome</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?</A><br>
<A NAME=100>When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</A><br>
<A NAME=103>And Brutus is an honourable man.</A><br>
<A NAME=104>You all did see that on the Lupercal</A><br>
<A NAME=105>I thrice presented him a kingly crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;</A><br>
<A NAME=108>And, sure, he is an honourable man.</A><br>
<A NAME=109>I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>But here I am to speak what I do know.</A><br>
<A NAME=111>You all did love him once, not without cause:</A><br>
<A NAME=112>What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?</A><br>
<A NAME=113>O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;</A><br>
<A NAME=115>My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>And I must pause till it come back to me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>First Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>Second Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>If thou consider rightly of the matter,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Caesar has had great wrong.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>Third Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=120>Has he, masters?</A><br>
<A NAME=121>I fear there will a worse come in his place.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>Fourth Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=122>Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>First Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=124>If it be found so, some will dear abide it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>Second Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=125>Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>Third Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=126>There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>Fourth Citizen</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=127>Now mark him, he begins again to speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>But yesterday the word of Caesar might</A><br>
<A NAME=129>Have stood against the world; now lies he there.</A><br>
<A NAME=130>And none so poor to do him reverence.</A><br>
<A NAME=131>O masters, if I were disposed to stir</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Who, you all know, are honourable men:</A><br>
<A NAME=135>I will not do them wrong; I rather choose</A><br>
<A NAME=136>To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Than I will wrong such honourable men.</A><br>
<A NAME=138>But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;</A><br>
<A NAME=139>I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Let but the commons hear this testament--</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--</A><br>
<A NAME=142>And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds</A><br>
<A NAME=143>And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>And, dying, mention it within their wills,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Bequeathing it as a rich legacy</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Unto their issue.</A><br>

<A NAME=179>You all do know this mantle: I remember</A><br>

<A NAME=181>'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,</A><br>
<A NAME=182>That day he overcame the Nervii:</A><br>
<A NAME=183>Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:</A><br>
<A NAME=184>See what a rent the envious Casca made:</A><br>
<A NAME=185>Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=186>And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,</A><br>
<A NAME=187>Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,</A><br>
<A NAME=188>As rushing out of doors, to be resolved</A><br>
<A NAME=189>If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;</A><br>
<A NAME=190>For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!</A><br>
<A NAME=192>This was the most unkindest cut of all;</A><br>
<A NAME=193>For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,</A><br>
<A NAME=194>Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,</A><br>
<A NAME=195>Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;</A><br>
<A NAME=196>And, in his mantle muffling up his face,</A><br>
<A NAME=197>Even at the base of Pompey's statua,</A><br>
<A NAME=198>Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.</A><br>
<A NAME=199>O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!</A><br>
