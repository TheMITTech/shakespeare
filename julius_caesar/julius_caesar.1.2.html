<p><blockquote>
<i>Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;  CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,  CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among them a Soothsayer</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Calpurnia!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>Here, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Stand you directly in Antonius' way,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>When he doth run his course. Antonius!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>Caesar, my lord?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>The barren, touched in this holy chase,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Shake off their sterile curse.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>I shall remember:</A><br>
<A NAME=13>When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>Set on; and leave no ceremony out.</A><br>
<p><i>Flourish</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Soothsayer</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>Caesar!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=16>Ha! who calls?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>Who is it in the press that calls on me?</A><br>
<A NAME=19>I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Soothsayer</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>Beware the ides of March.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=22>What man is that?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>Set him before me; let me see his face.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>CAESAR</b></a>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Soothsayer</b></a>

<A NAME=27>Beware the ides of March.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech21><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.</A><br>
<p><i>Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>Will you go see the order of the course?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Not I.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>I pray you, do.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>I am not gamesome: I do lack some part</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;</A><br>
<A NAME=35>I'll leave you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>Brutus, I do observe you now of late:</A><br>
<A NAME=37>I have not from your eyes that gentleness</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And show of love as I was wont to have:</A><br>
<A NAME=39>You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Over your friend that loves you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>Cassius,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>I turn the trouble of my countenance</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Merely upon myself. Vexed I am</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Of late with passions of some difference,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Conceptions only proper to myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Among which number, Cassius, be you one--</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Nor construe any further my neglect,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Forgets the shows of love to other men.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=53>Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;</A><br>
<A NAME=54>By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>But by reflection, by some other things.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>'Tis just:</A><br>
<A NAME=60>And it is very much lamented, Brutus,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>That you have no such mirrors as will turn</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Your hidden worthiness into your eye,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>That you might see your shadow. I have heard,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Where many of the best respect in Rome,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus</A><br>
<A NAME=66>And groaning underneath this age's yoke,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>That you would have me seek into myself</A><br>
<A NAME=70>For that which is not in me?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>And since you know you cannot see yourself</A><br>
<A NAME=73>So well as by reflection, I, your glass,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Will modestly discover to yourself</A><br>
<A NAME=75>That of yourself which you yet know not of.</A><br>
<A NAME=76>And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Were I a common laugher, or did use</A><br>
<A NAME=78>To stale with ordinary oaths my love</A><br>
<A NAME=79>To every new protester; if you know</A><br>
<A NAME=80>That I do fawn on men and hug them hard</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And after scandal them, or if you know</A><br>
<A NAME=82>That I profess myself in banqueting</A><br>
<A NAME=83>To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.</A><br>
<p><i>Flourish, and shout</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>What means this shouting? I do fear, the people</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Choose Caesar for their king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=86>Ay, do you fear it?</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Then must I think you would not have it so.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.</A><br>
<A NAME=89>But wherefore do you hold me here so long?</A><br>
<A NAME=90>What is it that you would impart to me?</A><br>
<A NAME=91>If it be aught toward the general good,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>And I will look on both indifferently,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>For let the gods so speed me as I love</A><br>
<A NAME=95>The name of honour more than I fear death.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>As well as I do know your outward favour.</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Well, honour is the subject of my story.</A><br>
<A NAME=99>I cannot tell what you and other men</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Think of this life; but, for my single self,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>I had as lief not be as live to be</A><br>
<A NAME=102>In awe of such a thing as I myself.</A><br>
<A NAME=103>I was born free as Caesar; so were you:</A><br>
<A NAME=104>We both have fed as well, and we can both</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Endure the winter's cold as well as he:</A><br>
<A NAME=106>For once, upon a raw and gusty day,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Leap in with me into this angry flood,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Accoutred as I was, I plunged in</A><br>
<A NAME=112>And bade him follow; so indeed he did.</A><br>
<A NAME=113>The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it</A><br>
<A NAME=114>With lusty sinews, throwing it aside</A><br>
<A NAME=115>And stemming it with hearts of controversy;</A><br>
<A NAME=116>But ere we could arrive the point proposed,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'</A><br>
<A NAME=118>I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder</A><br>
<A NAME=120>The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Did I the tired Caesar. And this man</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Is now become a god, and Cassius is</A><br>
<A NAME=123>A wretched creature and must bend his body,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.</A><br>
<A NAME=125>He had a fever when he was in Spain,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>And when the fit was on him, I did mark</A><br>
<A NAME=127>How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;</A><br>
<A NAME=128>His coward lips did from their colour fly,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world</A><br>
<A NAME=130>Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Mark him and write his speeches in their books,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'</A><br>
<A NAME=134>As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me</A><br>
<A NAME=135>A man of such a feeble temper should</A><br>
<A NAME=136>So get the start of the majestic world</A><br>
<A NAME=137>And bear the palm alone.</A><br>
<p><i>Shout. Flourish</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=138>Another general shout!</A><br>
<A NAME=139>I do believe that these applauses are</A><br>
<A NAME=140>For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Like a Colossus, and we petty men</A><br>
<A NAME=143>Walk under his huge legs and peep about</A><br>
<A NAME=144>To find ourselves dishonourable graves.</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Men at some time are masters of their fates:</A><br>
<A NAME=146>The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,</A><br>
<A NAME=147>But in ourselves, that we are underlings.</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Why should that name be sounded more than yours?</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Write them together, yours is as fair a name;</A><br>
<A NAME=151>Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Now, in the names of all the gods at once,</A><br>
<A NAME=155>Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!</A><br>
<A NAME=157>Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!</A><br>
<A NAME=158>When went there by an age, since the great flood,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>But it was famed with more than with one man?</A><br>
<A NAME=160>When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>When there is in it but one only man.</A><br>
<A NAME=164>O, you and I have heard our fathers say,</A><br>
<A NAME=165>There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd</A><br>
<A NAME=166>The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome</A><br>
<A NAME=167>As easily as a king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=168>That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;</A><br>
<A NAME=169>What you would work me to, I have some aim:</A><br>
<A NAME=170>How I have thought of this and of these times,</A><br>
<A NAME=171>I shall recount hereafter; for this present,</A><br>
<A NAME=172>I would not, so with love I might entreat you,</A><br>
<A NAME=173>Be any further moved. What you have said</A><br>
<A NAME=174>I will consider; what you have to say</A><br>
<A NAME=175>I will with patience hear, and find a time</A><br>
<A NAME=176>Both meet to hear and answer such high things.</A><br>
<A NAME=177>Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:</A><br>
<A NAME=178>Brutus had rather be a villager</A><br>
<A NAME=179>Than to repute himself a son of Rome</A><br>
<A NAME=180>Under these hard conditions as this time</A><br>
<A NAME=181>Is like to lay upon us.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=182>I am glad that my weak words</A><br>
<A NAME=183>Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=184>The games are done and Caesar is returning.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=185>As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;</A><br>
<A NAME=186>And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you</A><br>
<A NAME=187>What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.</A><br>
<p><i>Re-enter CAESAR and his Train</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=188>I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,</A><br>
<A NAME=189>The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,</A><br>
<A NAME=190>And all the rest look like a chidden train:</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=193>As we have seen him in the Capitol,</A><br>
<A NAME=194>Being cross'd in conference by some senators.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=195>Casca will tell us what the matter is.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=196>Antonius!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=197>Caesar?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=198>Let me have men about me that are fat;</A><br>
<A NAME=199>Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:</A><br>
<A NAME=200>Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;</A><br>
<A NAME=201>He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>ANTONY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=202>Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;</A><br>
<A NAME=203>He is a noble Roman and well given.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>CAESAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=204>Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Yet if my name were liable to fear,</A><br>
<A NAME=206>I do not know the man I should avoid</A><br>
<A NAME=207>So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;</A><br>
<A NAME=208>He is a great observer and he looks</A><br>
<A NAME=209>Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,</A><br>
<A NAME=210>As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;</A><br>
<A NAME=211>Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort</A><br>
<A NAME=212>As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit</A><br>
<A NAME=213>That could be moved to smile at any thing.</A><br>
<A NAME=214>Such men as he be never at heart's ease</A><br>
<A NAME=215>Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=216>And therefore are they very dangerous.</A><br>
<A NAME=217>I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd</A><br>
<A NAME=218>Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.</A><br>
<A NAME=219>Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,</A><br>
<A NAME=220>And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.</A><br>
<p><i>Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA</i></p>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=234>Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=237>Who offered him the crown?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech62><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=238>Why, Antony.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech63><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=239>Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech64><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=240>I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:</A><br>
<A NAME=241>it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark</A><br>
<A NAME=242>Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown</A><br>
<A NAME=243>neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told</A><br>
<A NAME=244>you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my</A><br>
<A NAME=245>thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he</A><br>
<A NAME=246>offered it to him again; then he put it by again:</A><br>
<A NAME=247>but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his</A><br>
<A NAME=248>fingers off it. And then he offered it the third</A><br>
<A NAME=249>time; he put it the third time by: and still as he</A><br>
<A NAME=250>refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their</A><br>
<A NAME=251>chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps</A><br>
<A NAME=252>and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because</A><br>
<A NAME=253>Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked</A><br>
<A NAME=254>Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and</A><br>
<A NAME=255>for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of</A><br>
<A NAME=256>opening my lips and receiving the bad air.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech65><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=257>But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech66><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=258>He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at</A><br>
<A NAME=259>mouth, and was speechless.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech67><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=260>'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech68><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=261>No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,</A><br>
<A NAME=262>And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech69><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=263>I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,</A><br>
<A NAME=264>Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not</A><br>
<A NAME=265>clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and</A><br>
<A NAME=266>displeased them, as they use to do the players in</A><br>
<A NAME=267>the theatre, I am no true man.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech70><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=268>What said he when he came unto himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech71><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=269>Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the</A><br>
<A NAME=270>common herd was glad he refused the crown, he</A><br>
<A NAME=271>plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his</A><br>
<A NAME=272>throat to cut. An I had been a man of any</A><br>
<A NAME=273>occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,</A><br>
<A NAME=274>I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so</A><br>
<A NAME=275>he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,</A><br>
<A NAME=276>If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired</A><br>
<A NAME=277>their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three</A><br>
<A NAME=278>or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good</A><br>
<A NAME=279>soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but</A><br>
<A NAME=280>there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had</A><br>
<A NAME=281>stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech72><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=282>And after that, he came, thus sad, away?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech73><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=283>Ay.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech74><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=284>Did Cicero say any thing?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech75><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=285>Ay, he spoke Greek.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech76><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=286>To what effect?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech77><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=287>Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the</A><br>
<A NAME=288>face again: but those that understood him smiled at</A><br>
<A NAME=289>one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own</A><br>
<A NAME=290>part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more</A><br>
<A NAME=291>news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs</A><br>
<A NAME=292>off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you</A><br>
<A NAME=293>well. There was more foolery yet, if I could</A><br>
<A NAME=294>remember it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech78><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=295>Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech79><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=296>No, I am promised forth.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech80><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=297>Will you dine with me to-morrow?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech81><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=298>Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner</A><br>
<A NAME=299>worth the eating.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech82><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=300>Good: I will expect you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech83><b>CASCA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=301>Do so. Farewell, both.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech84><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=302>What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!</A><br>
<A NAME=303>He was quick mettle when he went to school.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech85><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=304>So is he now in execution</A><br>
<A NAME=305>Of any bold or noble enterprise,</A><br>
<A NAME=306>However he puts on this tardy form.</A><br>
<A NAME=307>This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,</A><br>
<A NAME=308>Which gives men stomach to digest his words</A><br>
<A NAME=309>With better appetite.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech86><b>BRUTUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=310>And so it is. For this time I will leave you:</A><br>
<A NAME=311>To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,</A><br>
<A NAME=312>I will come home to you; or, if you will,</A><br>
<A NAME=313>Come home to me, and I will wait for you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech87><b>CASSIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=314>I will do so: till then, think of the world.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit BRUTUS</i></p>
<A NAME=315>Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,</A><br>
<A NAME=316>Thy honourable metal may be wrought</A><br>
<A NAME=317>From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet</A><br>
<A NAME=318>That noble minds keep ever with their likes;</A><br>
<A NAME=319>For who so firm that cannot be seduced?</A><br>
<A NAME=320>Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:</A><br>
<A NAME=321>If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,</A><br>
<A NAME=322>He should not humour me. I will this night,</A><br>
<A NAME=323>In several hands, in at his windows throw,</A><br>
<A NAME=324>As if they came from several citizens,</A><br>
<A NAME=325>Writings all tending to the great opinion</A><br>
<A NAME=326>That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely</A><br>
<A NAME=327>Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:</A><br>
<A NAME=328>And after this let Caesar seat him sure;</A><br>
<A NAME=329>For we will shake him, or worse days endure.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
