<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>LAUNCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a</A><br>
<A NAME=3>puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or</A><br>
<A NAME=4>four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.</A><br>
<A NAME=5>I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver</A><br>
<A NAME=7>him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;</A><br>
<A NAME=8>and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he</A><br>
<A NAME=9>steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:</A><br>
<A NAME=10>O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself</A><br>
<A NAME=11>in all companies! I would have, as one should say,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had</A><br>
<A NAME=14>more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I</A><br>
<A NAME=16>live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He</A><br>
<A NAME=17>thrusts me himself into the company of three or four</A><br>
<A NAME=18>gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had</A><br>
<A NAME=19>not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but</A><br>
<A NAME=20>all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says</A><br>
<A NAME=21>one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him</A><br>
<A NAME=22>out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>I, having been acquainted with the smell before,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that</A><br>
<A NAME=25>whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip</A><br>
<A NAME=26>the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him</A><br>
<A NAME=27>the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you</A><br>
<A NAME=28>wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out</A><br>
<A NAME=29>of the chamber. How many masters would do this for</A><br>
<A NAME=30>his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the</A><br>
<A NAME=31>stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had</A><br>
<A NAME=32>been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese</A><br>
<A NAME=33>he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the</A><br>
<A NAME=35>trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I</A><br>
<A NAME=37>do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make</A><br>
<A NAME=38>water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst</A><br>
<A NAME=39>thou ever see me do such a trick?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter PROTEUS and JULIA</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well</A><br>
<A NAME=41>And will employ thee in some service presently.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>In what you please: I'll do what I can.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>I hope thou wilt.</A><br>
<p><i>To LAUNCE</i></p>
<A NAME=44>How now, you whoreson peasant!</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Where have you been these two days loitering?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>LAUNCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>And what says she to my little jewel?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>LAUNCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=48>Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you</A><br>
<A NAME=49>currish thanks is good enough for such a present.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=50>But she received my dog?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>LAUNCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him</A><br>
<A NAME=52>back again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=53>What, didst thou offer her this from me?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>LAUNCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by</A><br>
<A NAME=55>the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I</A><br>
<A NAME=56>offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of</A><br>
<A NAME=57>yours, and therefore the gift the greater.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Or ne'er return again into my sight.</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?</A><br>
<p><i>Exit LAUNCE</i></p>
<A NAME=61>A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Sebastian, I have entertained thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Partly that I have need of such a youth</A><br>
<A NAME=64>That can with some discretion do my business,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Which, if my augury deceive me not,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Go presently and take this ring with thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Deliver it to Madam Silvia:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>She loved me well deliver'd it to me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.</A><br>
<A NAME=74>She is dead, belike?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>Not so; I think she lives.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>Alas!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Why dost thou cry 'alas'?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>I cannot choose</A><br>
<A NAME=79>But pity her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>                  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Because methinks that she loved you as well</A><br>
<A NAME=82>As you do love your lady Silvia:</A><br>
<A NAME=83>She dreams of him that has forgot her love;</A><br>
<A NAME=84>You dote on her that cares not for your love.</A><br>
<A NAME=85>'Tis pity love should be so contrary;</A><br>
<A NAME=86>And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>PROTEUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>Well, give her that ring and therewithal</A><br>
<A NAME=88>This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady</A><br>
<A NAME=89>I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>How many women would do such a message?</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd</A><br>
<A NAME=94>A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him</A><br>
<A NAME=96>That with his very heart despiseth me?</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Because he loves her, he despiseth me;</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Because I love him I must pity him.</A><br>
<A NAME=99>This ring I gave him when he parted from me,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>To bind him to remember my good will;</A><br>
<A NAME=101>And now am I, unhappy messenger,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>To plead for that which I would not obtain,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>To carry that which I would have refused,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.</A><br>
<A NAME=105>I am my master's true-confirmed love;</A><br>
<A NAME=106>But cannot be true servant to my master,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Unless I prove false traitor to myself.</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly</A><br>
<A NAME=109>As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter SILVIA, attended</i></p>
<A NAME=110>Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean</A><br>
<A NAME=111>To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=112>What would you with her, if that I be she?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>If you be she, I do entreat your patience</A><br>
<A NAME=114>To hear me speak the message I am sent on.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=115>From whom?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>O, he sends you for a picture.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>Ay, madam.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>Ursula, bring my picture here.</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Go give your master this: tell him from me,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=123>Madam, please you peruse this letter.--</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:</A><br>
<A NAME=126>This is the letter to your ladyship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=127>I pray thee, let me look on that again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>It may not be; good madam, pardon me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>There, hold!</A><br>
<A NAME=130>I will not look upon your master's lines:</A><br>
<A NAME=131>I know they are stuff'd with protestations</A><br>
<A NAME=132>And full of new-found oaths; which he will break</A><br>
<A NAME=133>As easily as I do tear his paper.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=134>Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>The more shame for him that he sends it me;</A><br>
<A NAME=136>For I have heard him say a thousand times</A><br>
<A NAME=137>His Julia gave it him at his departure.</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Though his false finger have profaned the ring,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>She thanks you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>What say'st thou?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=142>I thank you, madam, that you tender her.</A><br>
<A NAME=143>Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>Dost thou know her?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=145>Almost as well as I do know myself:</A><br>
<A NAME=146>To think upon her woes I do protest</A><br>
<A NAME=147>That I have wept a hundred several times.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=148>Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=149>I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=150>Is she not passing fair?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=151>She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:</A><br>
<A NAME=152>When she did think my master loved her well,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:</A><br>
<A NAME=154>But since she did neglect her looking-glass</A><br>
<A NAME=155>And threw her sun-expelling mask away,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks</A><br>
<A NAME=157>And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,</A><br>
<A NAME=158>That now she is become as black as I.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=159>How tall was she?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=160>About my stature; for at Pentecost,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>When all our pageants of delight were play'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Our youth got me to play the woman's part,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,</A><br>
<A NAME=165>As if the garment had been made for me:</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Therefore I know she is about my height.</A><br>
<A NAME=167>And at that time I made her weep agood,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>For I did play a lamentable part:</A><br>
<A NAME=169>Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning</A><br>
<A NAME=170>For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Which I so lively acted with my tears</A><br>
<A NAME=172>That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,</A><br>
<A NAME=173>Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead</A><br>
<A NAME=174>If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>SILVIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=175>She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.</A><br>
<A NAME=176>Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!</A><br>
<A NAME=177>I weep myself to think upon thy words.</A><br>
<A NAME=178>Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this</A><br>
<A NAME=179>For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.</A><br>
<A NAME=180>Farewell.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit SILVIA, with attendants</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>JULIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=181>And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.</A><br>
<A NAME=182>A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful</A><br>
<A NAME=183>I hope my master's suit will be but cold,</A><br>
<A NAME=184>Since she respects my mistress' love so much.</A><br>
<A NAME=185>Alas, how love can trifle with itself!</A><br>
<A NAME=186>Here is her picture: let me see; I think,</A><br>
<A NAME=187>If I had such a tire, this face of mine</A><br>
<A NAME=188>Were full as lovely as is this of hers:</A><br>
<A NAME=189>And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,</A><br>
<A NAME=190>Unless I flatter with myself too much.</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:</A><br>
<A NAME=192>If that be all the difference in his love,</A><br>
<A NAME=193>I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.</A><br>
<A NAME=194>Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:</A><br>
<A NAME=195>Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.</A><br>
<A NAME=196>What should it be that he respects in her</A><br>
<A NAME=197>But I can make respective in myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=198>If this fond Love were not a blinded god?</A><br>
<A NAME=199>Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,</A><br>
<A NAME=200>For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,</A><br>
<A NAME=201>Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!</A><br>
<A NAME=202>And, were there sense in his idolatry,</A><br>
<A NAME=203>My substance should be statue in thy stead.</A><br>
<A NAME=204>I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,</A><br>
<A NAME=205>That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,</A><br>
<A NAME=206>I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=207>To make my master out of love with thee!</A><br>
