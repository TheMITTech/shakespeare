<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter KING RICHARD</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>I have been studying how I may compare</A><br>
<A NAME=2>This prison where I live unto the world:</A><br>
<A NAME=3>And for because the world is populous</A><br>
<A NAME=4>And here is not a creature but myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.</A><br>
<A NAME=6>My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>My soul the father; and these two beget</A><br>
<A NAME=8>A generation of still-breeding thoughts,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>And these same thoughts people this little world,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>In humours like the people of this world,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>For no thought is contented. The better sort,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd</A><br>
<A NAME=13>With scruples and do set the word itself</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Against the word:</A><br>
<A NAME=15>As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>'It is as hard to come as for a camel</A><br>
<A NAME=17>To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails</A><br>
<A NAME=20>May tear a passage through the flinty ribs</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves</A><br>
<A NAME=24>That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>That many have and others must sit there;</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And in this thought they find a kind of ease,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Bearing their own misfortunes on the back</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Of such as have before endured the like.</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Thus play I in one person many people,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>And none contented: sometimes am I king;</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>And so I am: then crushing penury</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Persuades me I was better when a king;</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Then am I king'd again: and by and by</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Nor I nor any man that but man is</A><br>
<A NAME=40>With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased</A><br>
<A NAME=41>With being nothing. Music do I hear?</A><br>
<p><i>Music</i></p>
<A NAME=42>Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>When time is broke and no proportion kept!</A><br>
<A NAME=44>So is it in the music of men's lives.</A><br>
<A NAME=45>And here have I the daintiness of ear</A><br>
<A NAME=46>To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;</A><br>
<A NAME=47>But for the concord of my state and time</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.</A><br>
<A NAME=49>I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;</A><br>
<A NAME=50>For now hath time made me his numbering clock:</A><br>
<A NAME=51>My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.</A><br>
<A NAME=61>This music mads me; let it sound no more;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>For though it have holp madmen to their wits,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>In me it seems it will make wise men mad.</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!</A><br>
<A NAME=65>For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Groom of the Stable</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Groom</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Hail, royal prince!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Thanks, noble peer;</A><br>
<A NAME=69>The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.</A><br>
<A NAME=70>What art thou? and how comest thou hither,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Where no man never comes but that sad dog</A><br>
<A NAME=72>That brings me food to make misfortune live?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Groom</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>With much ado at length have gotten leave</A><br>
<A NAME=76>To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.</A><br>
<A NAME=77>O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld</A><br>
<A NAME=78>In London streets, that coronation-day,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>How went he under him?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Groom</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!</A><br>
<A NAME=86>That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;</A><br>
<A NAME=87>This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Of that proud man that did usurp his back?</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Since thou, created to be awed by man,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;</A><br>
<A NAME=94>And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Keeper, with a dish</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Keeper</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Groom</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>Keeper</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>My lord, will't please you to fall to?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>Keeper</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=101>My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who</A><br>
<A NAME=102>lately came from the king, commands the contrary.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.</A><br>
<p><i>Beats the keeper</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>Keeper</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=105>Help, help, help!</A><br>
<p><i>Enter EXTON and Servants, armed</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=106>How now! what means death in this rude assault?</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.</A><br>
<p><i>Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him</i></p>
<A NAME=108>Go thou, and fill another room in hell.</A><br>
<p><i>He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down</i></p>
<A NAME=109>That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire</A><br>
<A NAME=110>That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.</A><br>
<p><i>Dies</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>EXTON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>As full of valour as of royal blood:</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!</A><br>
<A NAME=116>For now the devil, that told me I did well,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.</A><br>
<A NAME=118>This dead king to the living king I'll bear</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
