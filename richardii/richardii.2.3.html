<H3>SCENE III. Wilds in Gloucestershire.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>Believe me, noble lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>These high wild hills and rough uneven ways</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Making the hard way sweet and delectable.</A><br>
<A NAME=8>But I bethink me what a weary way</A><br>
<A NAME=9>From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found</A><br>
<A NAME=10>In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled</A><br>
<A NAME=12>The tediousness and process of my travel:</A><br>
<A NAME=13>But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have</A><br>
<A NAME=14>The present benefit which I possess;</A><br>
<A NAME=15>And hope to joy is little less in joy</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done</A><br>
<A NAME=18>By sight of what I have, your noble company.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>Of much less value is my company</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Than your good words. But who comes here?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter HENRY PERCY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>It is my son, young Harry Percy,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Harry, how fares your uncle?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>HENRY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Why, is he not with the queen?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>HENRY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=26>No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Broken his staff of office and dispersed</A><br>
<A NAME=28>The household of the king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>What was his reason?</A><br>
<A NAME=30>He was not so resolved when last we spake together.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>HENRY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.</A><br>
<A NAME=32>But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover</A><br>
<A NAME=35>What power the Duke of York had levied there;</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>HENRY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>No, my good lord, for that is not forgot</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>I never in my life did look on him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>HENRY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>My gracious lord, I tender you my service,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Which elder days shall ripen and confirm</A><br>
<A NAME=45>To more approved service and desert.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure</A><br>
<A NAME=47>I count myself in nothing else so happy</A><br>
<A NAME=48>As in a soul remembering my good friends;</A><br>
<A NAME=49>And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>It shall be still thy true love's recompense:</A><br>
<A NAME=51>My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Keeps good old York there with his men of war?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>HENRY PERCY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;</A><br>
<A NAME=56>And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;</A><br>
<A NAME=57>None else of name and noble estimate.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues</A><br>
<A NAME=61>A banish'd traitor: all my treasury</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Shall be your love and labour's recompense.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>LORD ROSS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>LORD WILLOUGHBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>And far surmounts our labour to attain it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter LORD BERKELEY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>LORD BERKELEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;</A><br>
<A NAME=72>And I am come to seek that name in England;</A><br>
<A NAME=73>And I must find that title in your tongue,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Before I make reply to aught you say.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>LORD BERKELEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning</A><br>
<A NAME=76>To raze one title of your honour out:</A><br>
<A NAME=77>To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>From the most gracious regent of this land,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on</A><br>
<A NAME=80>To take advantage of the absent time</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And fright our native peace with self-born arms.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter DUKE OF YORK attended</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>I shall not need transport my words by you;</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!</A><br>
<p><i>Kneels</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Whose duty is deceiveable and false.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=86>My gracious uncle--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>Tut, tut!</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:</A><br>
<A NAME=89>I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'</A><br>
<A NAME=90>In an ungracious mouth is but profane.</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?</A><br>
<A NAME=93>But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march</A><br>
<A NAME=94>So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Frighting her pale-faced villages with war</A><br>
<A NAME=96>And ostentation of despised arms?</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>And in my loyal bosom lies his power.</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Were I but now the lord of such hot youth</A><br>
<A NAME=101>As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>From forth the ranks of many thousand French,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee</A><br>
<A NAME=106>And minister correction to thy fault!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:</A><br>
<A NAME=108>On what condition stands it and wherein?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=109>Even in condition of the worst degree,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>In gross rebellion and detested treason:</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Before the expiration of thy time,</A><br>
<A NAME=113>In braving arms against thy sovereign.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;</A><br>
<A NAME=115>But as I come, I come for Lancaster.</A><br>
<A NAME=116>And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:</A><br>
<A NAME=118>You are my father, for methinks in you</A><br>
<A NAME=119>I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd</A><br>
<A NAME=121>A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away</A><br>
<A NAME=123>To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?</A><br>
<A NAME=124>If that my cousin king be King of England,</A><br>
<A NAME=125>It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.</A><br>
<A NAME=126>You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.</A><br>
<A NAME=130>I am denied to sue my livery here,</A><br>
<A NAME=131>And yet my letters-patents give me leave:</A><br>
<A NAME=132>My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>And these and all are all amiss employ'd.</A><br>
<A NAME=134>What would you have me do? I am a subject,</A><br>
<A NAME=135>And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;</A><br>
<A NAME=136>And therefore, personally I lay my claim</A><br>
<A NAME=137>To my inheritance of free descent.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=138>The noble duke hath been too much abused.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>LORD ROSS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>It stands your grace upon to do him right.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>LORD WILLOUGHBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>Base men by his endowments are made great.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>My lords of England, let me tell you this:</A><br>
<A NAME=142>I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs</A><br>
<A NAME=143>And laboured all I could to do him right;</A><br>
<A NAME=144>But in this kind to come, in braving arms,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Be his own carver and cut out his way,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>To find out right with wrong, it may not be;</A><br>
<A NAME=147>And you that do abet him in this kind</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=149>The noble duke hath sworn his coming is</A><br>
<A NAME=150>But for his own; and for the right of that</A><br>
<A NAME=151>We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;</A><br>
<A NAME=152>And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=153>Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:</A><br>
<A NAME=154>I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,</A><br>
<A NAME=155>Because my power is weak and all ill left:</A><br>
<A NAME=156>But if I could, by Him that gave me life,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>I would attach you all and make you stoop</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;</A><br>
<A NAME=159>But since I cannot, be it known to you</A><br>
<A NAME=160>I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Unless you please to enter in the castle</A><br>
<A NAME=162>And there repose you for this night.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>HENRY BOLINGBROKE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=163>An offer, uncle, that we will accept:</A><br>
<A NAME=164>But we must win your grace to go with us</A><br>
<A NAME=165>To Bristol castle, which they say is held</A><br>
<A NAME=166>By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>The caterpillars of the commonwealth,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=169>It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;</A><br>
<A NAME=170>For I am loath to break our country's laws.</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:</A><br>
<A NAME=172>Things past redress are now with me past care.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
