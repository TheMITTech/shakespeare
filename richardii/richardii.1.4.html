<H3>SCENE IV. The court.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>How far brought you high Hereford on his way?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>But to the next highway, and there I left him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>And say, what store of parting tears were shed?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Which then blew bitterly against our faces,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>What said our cousin when you parted with him?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>'Farewell:'</A><br>
<A NAME=12>And, for my heart disdained that my tongue</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Should so profane the word, that taught me craft</A><br>
<A NAME=14>To counterfeit oppression of such grief</A><br>
<A NAME=15>That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours</A><br>
<A NAME=17>And added years to his short banishment,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>He should have had a volume of farewells;</A><br>
<A NAME=19>But since it would not, he had none of me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>When time shall call him home from banishment,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Observed his courtship to the common people;</A><br>
<A NAME=25>How he did seem to dive into their hearts</A><br>
<A NAME=26>With humble and familiar courtesy,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>What reverence he did throw away on slaves,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles</A><br>
<A NAME=29>And patient underbearing of his fortune,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>As 'twere to banish their affects with him.</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;</A><br>
<A NAME=32>A brace of draymen bid God speed him well</A><br>
<A NAME=33>And had the tribute of his supple knee,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'</A><br>
<A NAME=35>As were our England in reversion his,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>And he our subjects' next degree in hope.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>GREEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Expedient manage must be made, my liege,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Ere further leisure yield them further means</A><br>
<A NAME=41>For their advantage and your highness' loss.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>We will ourself in person to this war:</A><br>
<A NAME=43>And, for our coffers, with too great a court</A><br>
<A NAME=44>And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>We are inforced to farm our royal realm;</A><br>
<A NAME=46>The revenue whereof shall furnish us</A><br>
<A NAME=47>For our affairs in hand: if that come short,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And send them after to supply our wants;</A><br>
<A NAME=52>For we will make for Ireland presently.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BUSHY</i></p>
<A NAME=53>Bushy, what news?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>BUSHY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste</A><br>
<A NAME=56>To entreat your majesty to visit him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>Where lies he?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>BUSHY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>At Ely House.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>Now put it, God, in the physician's mind</A><br>
<A NAME=60>To help him to his grave immediately!</A><br>
<A NAME=61>The lining of his coffers shall make coats</A><br>
<A NAME=62>To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>All</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>Amen.</A><br>
