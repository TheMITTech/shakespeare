<i>Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick, with the DUKE OF YORK, & c</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Will the king come, that I may breathe my last</A><br>
<A NAME=2>In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;</A><br>
<A NAME=4>For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>O, but they say the tongues of dying men</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Enforce attention like deep harmony:</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.</A><br>
<A NAME=9>He that no more must say is listen'd more</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;</A><br>
<A NAME=11>More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:</A><br>
<A NAME=12>The setting sun, and music at the close,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Writ in remembrance more than things long past:</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>DUKE OF YORK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound</A><br>
<A NAME=20>The open ear of youth doth always listen;</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Report of fashions in proud Italy,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Whose manners still our tardy apish nation</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Limps after in base imitation.</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--</A><br>
<A NAME=25>So it be new, there's no respect how vile--</A><br>
<A NAME=26>That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Direct not him whose way himself will choose:</A><br>
<A NAME=30>'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Methinks I am a prophet new inspired</A><br>
<A NAME=32>And thus expiring do foretell of him:</A><br>
<A NAME=33>His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>For violent fires soon burn out themselves;</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;</A><br>
<A NAME=36>He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;</A><br>
<A NAME=37>With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.</A><br>
<A NAME=40>This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>This other Eden, demi-paradise,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>This fortress built by Nature for herself</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Against infection and the hand of war,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>This happy breed of men, this little world,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>This precious stone set in the silver sea,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Which serves it in the office of a wall,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Or as a moat defensive to a house,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Against the envy of less happier lands,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Renowned for their deeds as far from home,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>For Christian service and true chivalry,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Dear for her reputation through the world,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Like to a tenement or pelting farm:</A><br>
<A NAME=61>England, bound in with the triumphant sea</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:</A><br>
<A NAME=65>That England, that was wont to conquer others,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>How happy then were my ensuing death!</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>O how that name befits my composition!</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;</A><br>
<A NAME=76>And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?</A><br>
<A NAME=77>For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:</A><br>
<A NAME=79>The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>Can sick men play so nicely with their names?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>No, misery makes sport to mock itself:</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>Should dying men flatter with those that live?</A><br>

<A NAME=speech13><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=89>No, no, men living flatter those that die.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;</A><br>
<A NAME=94>Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;</A><br>
<A NAME=97>And thou, too careless patient as thou art,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Of those physicians that first wounded thee:</A><br>
<A NAME=100>A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;</A><br>
<A NAME=102>And yet, incaged in so small a verge,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.</A><br>
<A NAME=104>O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>It were a shame to let this land by lease;</A><br>
<A NAME=111>But for thy world enjoying but this land,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Is it not more than shame to shame it so?</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Landlord of England art thou now, not king:</A><br>

<A NAME=118>Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood</A><br>
<A NAME=119>With fury from his native residence.</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,</A><br>

<A NAME=122>This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>JOHN OF GAUNT</b></a>

<A NAME=125>For that I was his father Edward's son;</A><br>
<A NAME=126>That blood already, like the pelican,</A><br>

<A NAME=132>Join with the present sickness that I have;</A><br>
<A NAME=133>And thy unkindness be like crooked age,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!</A><br>
<A NAME=136>These words hereafter thy tormentors be!</A><br>

<A NAME=269>We see the very wreck that we must suffer;</A><br>

<A NAME=271>For suffering so the causes of our wreck.</A><br>

<A NAME=272>Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death</A><br>
<A NAME=273>I spy life peering; but I dare not say</A><br>
<A NAME=274>How near the tidings of our comfort is.</A><br>

<A NAME=275>Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech54><b>LORD ROSS</b></a>

<A NAME=276>Be confident to speak, Northumberland:</A><br>
<A NAME=277>We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,</A><br>

<A NAME=279>Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay</A><br>
<A NAME=280>In Brittany, received intelligence</A><br>
<A NAME=281>That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,</A><br>
<A NAME=282>That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,</A><br>
<A NAME=283>His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,</A><br>
<A NAME=284>Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,</A><br>
<A NAME=285>Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,</A><br>
<A NAME=286>All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne</A><br>
<A NAME=287>With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,</A><br>
<A NAME=288>Are making hither with all due expedience</A><br>
<A NAME=289>And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:</A><br>
<A NAME=290>Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay</A><br>
<A NAME=291>The first departing of the king for Ireland.</A><br>
<A NAME=292>If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,</A><br>
<A NAME=293>Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,</A><br>
<A NAME=294>Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=295>Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt</A><br>
<A NAME=296>And make high majesty look like itself,</A><br>
<A NAME=297>Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;</A><br>
<A NAME=298>But if you faint, as fearing to do so,</A><br>
<A NAME=299>Stay and be secret, and myself will go.</A><br>
