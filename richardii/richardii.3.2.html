<H3>SCENE II. The coast of Wales. A castle in view.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>After your late tossing on the breaking seas?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy</A><br>
<A NAME=5>To stand upon my kingdom once again.</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:</A><br>
<A NAME=8>As a long-parted mother with her child</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>And do thee favours with my royal hands.</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;</A><br>
<A NAME=14>But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Which with usurping steps do trample thee:</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;</A><br>
<A NAME=19>And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:</A><br>
<A NAME=24>This earth shall have a feeling and these stones</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=27>Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.</A><br>
<A NAME=29>The means that heaven yields must be embraced,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>And not neglected; else, if heaven would,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>The proffer'd means of succor and redress.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Grows strong and great in substance and in power.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not</A><br>
<A NAME=37>That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen</A><br>
<A NAME=40>In murders and in outrage, boldly here;</A><br>
<A NAME=41>But when from under this terrestrial ball</A><br>
<A NAME=42>He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines</A><br>
<A NAME=43>And darts his light through every guilty hole,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Then murders, treasons and detested sins,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?</A><br>
<A NAME=47>So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Who all this while hath revell'd in the night</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>His treasons will sit blushing in his face,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Not able to endure the sight of day,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Not all the water in the rough rude sea</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;</A><br>
<A NAME=56>The breath of worldly men cannot depose</A><br>
<A NAME=57>The deputy elected by the Lord:</A><br>
<A NAME=58>For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd</A><br>
<A NAME=59>To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay</A><br>
<A NAME=61>A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter EARL OF SALISBURY</i></p>
<A NAME=63>Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>EARL OF SALISBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue</A><br>
<A NAME=66>And bids me speak of nothing but despair.</A><br>
<A NAME=67>One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:</A><br>
<A NAME=69>O, call back yesterday, bid time return,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!</A><br>
<A NAME=71>To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:</A><br>
<A NAME=73>For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>But now the blood of twenty thousand men</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;</A><br>
<A NAME=78>And, till so much blood thither come again,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Have I not reason to look pale and dead?</A><br>
<A NAME=80>All souls that will be safe fly from my side,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>For time hath set a blot upon my pride.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>I had forgot myself; am I not king?</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes</A><br>
<A NAME=87>At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?</A><br>
<A NAME=89>High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>More health and happiness betide my liege</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;</A><br>
<A NAME=94>The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care</A><br>
<A NAME=96>And what loss is it to be rid of care?</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;</A><br>
<A NAME=101>They break their faith to God as well as us:</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:</A><br>
<A NAME=103>The worst is death, and death will have his day.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=104>Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd</A><br>
<A NAME=105>To bear the tidings of calamity.</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Like an unseasonable stormy day,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>As if the world were all dissolved to tears,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>So high above his limits swells the rage</A><br>
<A NAME=110>Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land</A><br>
<A NAME=111>With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.</A><br>
<A NAME=112>White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>Strive to speak big and clap their female joints</A><br>
<A NAME=115>In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:</A><br>
<A NAME=116>The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Of double-fatal yew against thy state;</A><br>
<A NAME=118>Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>And all goes worse than I have power to tell.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=121>Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?</A><br>
<A NAME=123>What is become of Bushy? where is Green?</A><br>
<A NAME=124>That they have let the dangerous enemy</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?</A><br>
<A NAME=126>If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:</A><br>
<A NAME=127>I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!</A><br>
<A NAME=130>Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Would they make peace? terrible hell make war</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Upon their spotted souls for this offence!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>Sweet love, I see, changing his property,</A><br>
<A NAME=136>Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made</A><br>
<A NAME=138>With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse</A><br>
<A NAME=139>Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound</A><br>
<A NAME=140>And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=142>Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>Where is the duke my father with his power?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>No matter where; of comfort no man speak:</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Let's choose executors and talk of wills:</A><br>
<A NAME=149>And yet not so, for what can we bequeath</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Save our deposed bodies to the ground?</A><br>
<A NAME=151>Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,</A><br>
<A NAME=152>And nothing can we call our own but death</A><br>
<A NAME=153>And that small model of the barren earth</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.</A><br>
<A NAME=155>For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground</A><br>
<A NAME=156>And tell sad stories of the death of kings;</A><br>
<A NAME=157>How some have been deposed; some slain in war,</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;</A><br>
<A NAME=159>Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=160>All murder'd: for within the hollow crown</A><br>
<A NAME=161>That rounds the mortal temples of a king</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Allowing him a breath, a little scene,</A><br>
<A NAME=165>To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Infusing him with self and vain conceit,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>As if this flesh which walls about our life,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus</A><br>
<A NAME=169>Comes at the last and with a little pin</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood</A><br>
<A NAME=172>With solemn reverence: throw away respect,</A><br>
<A NAME=173>Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,</A><br>
<A NAME=174>For you have but mistook me all this while:</A><br>
<A NAME=175>I live with bread like you, feel want,</A><br>
<A NAME=176>Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,</A><br>
<A NAME=177>How can you say to me, I am a king?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>BISHOP OF CARLISLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=178>My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,</A><br>
<A NAME=179>But presently prevent the ways to wail.</A><br>
<A NAME=180>To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,</A><br>
<A NAME=181>Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,</A><br>
<A NAME=182>And so your follies fight against yourself.</A><br>
<A NAME=183>Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:</A><br>
<A NAME=184>And fight and die is death destroying death;</A><br>
<A NAME=185>Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>DUKE OF AUMERLE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=186>My father hath a power; inquire of him</A><br>
<A NAME=187>And learn to make a body of a limb.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=188>Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come</A><br>
<A NAME=189>To change blows with thee for our day of doom.</A><br>
<A NAME=190>This ague fit of fear is over-blown;</A><br>
<A NAME=191>An easy task it is to win our own.</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?</A><br>
<A NAME=193>Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>SIR STEPHEN SCROOP</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=194>Men judge by the complexion of the sky</A><br>
<A NAME=195>The state and inclination of the day:</A><br>
<A NAME=196>So may you by my dull and heavy eye,</A><br>
<A NAME=197>My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.</A><br>
<A NAME=198>I play the torturer, by small and small</A><br>
<A NAME=199>To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:</A><br>
<A NAME=200>Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,</A><br>
<A NAME=201>And all your northern castles yielded up,</A><br>
<A NAME=202>And all your southern gentlemen in arms</A><br>
<A NAME=203>Upon his party.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>KING RICHARD II</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=204>                  Thou hast said enough.</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth</A><br>
<p><i>To DUKE OF AUMERLE</i></p>
<A NAME=206>Of that sweet way I was in to despair!</A><br>
<A NAME=207>What say you now? what comfort have we now?</A><br>
<A NAME=208>By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly</A><br>
<A NAME=209>That bids me be of comfort any more.</A><br>
<A NAME=210>Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;</A><br>
<A NAME=211>A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.</A><br>
<A NAME=212>That power I have, discharge; and let them go</A><br>
<A NAME=213>To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,</A><br>
<A NAME=214>For I have none: let no man speak again</A><br>
<A NAME=215>To alter this, for counsel is but vain.</A><br>
