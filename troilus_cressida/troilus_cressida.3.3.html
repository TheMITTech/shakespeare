<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX, MENELAUS, and CALCHAS</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>CALCHAS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Now, princes, for the service I have done you,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>The advantage of the time prompts me aloud</A><br>
<A NAME=3>To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind</A><br>
<A NAME=4>That, through the sight I bear in things to love,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>From certain and possess'd conveniences,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all</A><br>
<A NAME=9>That time, acquaintance, custom and condition</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Made tame and most familiar to my nature,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>And here, to do you service, am become</A><br>
<A NAME=12>As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:</A><br>
<A NAME=13>I do beseech you, as in way of taste,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>To give me now a little benefit,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Out of those many register'd in promise,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>CALCHAS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>I know, is such a wrest in their affairs</A><br>
<A NAME=24>That their negotiations all must slack,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Wanting his manage; and they will almost</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Shall quite strike off all service I have done,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>In most accepted pain.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Let Diomedes bear him,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have</A><br>
<A NAME=33>What he requests of us. Good Diomed,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Furnish you fairly for this interchange:</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>DIOMEDES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Which I am proud to bear.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS</i></p>
<p><i>Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Please it our general to pass strangely by him,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>As if he were forgot; and, princes all,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:</A><br>
<A NAME=43>I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:</A><br>
<A NAME=45>If so, I have derision medicinable,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>To use between your strangeness and his pride,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Which his own will shall have desire to drink:</A><br>
<A NAME=48>It may be good: pride hath no other glass</A><br>
<A NAME=49>To show itself but pride, for supple knees</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>We'll execute your purpose, and put on</A><br>
<A NAME=52>A form of strangeness as we pass along:</A><br>
<A NAME=53>So do each lord, and either greet him not,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>What, comes the general to speak with me?</A><br>
<A NAME=57>You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>What says Achilles? would he aught with us?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>Would you, my lord, aught with the general?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>No.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Nothing, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>The better.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>Good day, good day.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>MENELAUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>How do you? how do you?</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>What, does the cuckold scorn me?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>AJAX</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>How now, Patroclus!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Good morrow, Ajax.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>AJAX</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Ha?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>Good morrow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>AJAX</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>Ay, and good next day too.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>PATROCLUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=72>They pass by strangely: they were used to bend</A><br>
<A NAME=73>To send their smiles before them to Achilles;</A><br>
<A NAME=74>To come as humbly as they used to creep</A><br>
<A NAME=75>To holy altars.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>                  What, am I poor of late?</A><br>
<A NAME=77>'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Must fall out with men too: what the declined is</A><br>
<A NAME=79>He shall as soon read in the eyes of others</A><br>
<A NAME=80>As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>And not a man, for being simply man,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Hath any honour, but honour for those honours</A><br>
<A NAME=84>That are without him, as place, riches, favour,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Prizes of accident as oft as merit:</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Do one pluck down another and together</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy</A><br>
<A NAME=91>At ample point all that I did possess,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Something not worth in me such rich beholding</A><br>
<A NAME=94>As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;</A><br>
<A NAME=95>I'll interrupt his reading.</A><br>
<A NAME=96>How now Ulysses!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>                  Now, great Thetis' son!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>What are you reading?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>A strange fellow here</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>How much in having, or without or in,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>As when his virtues shining upon others</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Heat them and they retort that heat again</A><br>
<A NAME=106>To the first giver.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>This is not strange, Ulysses.</A><br>
<A NAME=108>The beauty that is borne here in the face</A><br>
<A NAME=109>The bearer knows not, but commends itself</A><br>
<A NAME=110>To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Salutes each other with each other's form;</A><br>
<A NAME=114>For speculation turns not to itself,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>I do not strain at the position,--</A><br>
<A NAME=118>It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves</A><br>
<A NAME=120>That no man is the lord of any thing,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Though in and of him there be much consisting,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Till he communicate his parts to others:</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Nor doth he of himself know them for aught</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Till he behold them form'd in the applause</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Where they're extended; who, like an arch,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>reverberates</A><br>
<A NAME=127>The voice again, or, like a gate of steel</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Fronting the sun, receives and renders back</A><br>
<A NAME=129>His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;</A><br>
<A NAME=130>And apprehended here immediately</A><br>
<A NAME=131>The unknown Ajax.</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Most abject in regard and dear in use!</A><br>
<A NAME=135>What things again most dear in the esteem</A><br>
<A NAME=136>And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--</A><br>
<A NAME=137>An act that very chance doth throw upon him--</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>While some men leave to do!</A><br>
<A NAME=140>How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!</A><br>
<A NAME=142>How one man eats into another's pride,</A><br>
<A NAME=143>While pride is fasting in his wantonness!</A><br>
<A NAME=144>To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already</A><br>
<A NAME=145>They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast</A><br>
<A NAME=147>And great Troy shrieking.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>ACHILLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=148>I do believe it; for they pass'd by me</A><br>
<A NAME=149>As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=151>Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd</A><br>
<A NAME=155>As fast as they are made, forgot as soon</A><br>
<A NAME=156>As done: perseverance, dear my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail</A><br>
<A NAME=159>In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;</A><br>
<A NAME=160>For honour travels in a strait so narrow,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;</A><br>
<A NAME=162>For emulation hath a thousand sons</A><br>
<A NAME=163>That one by one pursue: if you give way,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,</A><br>
<A NAME=165>Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by</A><br>
<A NAME=166>And leave you hindmost;</A><br>
<A NAME=167>Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,</A><br>
<A NAME=169>O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;</A><br>
<A NAME=171>For time is like a fashionable host</A><br>
<A NAME=172>That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=173>And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,</A><br>
<A NAME=174>Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,</A><br>
<A NAME=175>And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not</A><br>
<A NAME=176>virtue seek</A><br>
<A NAME=177>Remuneration for the thing it was;</A><br>
<A NAME=178>For beauty, wit,</A><br>
<A NAME=179>High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,</A><br>
<A NAME=180>Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all</A><br>
<A NAME=181>To envious and calumniating time.</A><br>
<A NAME=182>One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,</A><br>
<A NAME=183>That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,</A><br>
<A NAME=184>Though they are made and moulded of things past,</A><br>
<A NAME=185>And give to dust that is a little gilt</A><br>
<A NAME=186>More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.</A><br>
<A NAME=187>The present eye praises the present object.</A><br>
<A NAME=188>Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,</A><br>
<A NAME=189>That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;</A><br>
<A NAME=190>Since things in motion sooner catch the eye</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=192>And still it might, and yet it may again,</A><br>
<A NAME=193>If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive</A><br>
<A NAME=194>And case thy reputation in thy tent;</A><br>
<A NAME=195>Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,</A><br>
<A NAME=196>Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves</A><br>
<A NAME=197>And drave great Mars to faction.</A><br>
</blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=200>But 'gainst your privacy</A><br>

<A NAME=202>'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love</A><br>
<A NAME=203>With one of Priam's daughters.</A><br>

<A NAME=208>Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,</A><br>
<A NAME=209>Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,</A><br>
<A NAME=210>Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.</A><br>
<A NAME=211>There is a mystery--with whom relation</A><br>
<A NAME=212>Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;</A><br>
<A NAME=213>Which hath an operation more divine</A><br>
<A NAME=214>Than breath or pen can give expressure to:</A><br>
<A NAME=215>All the commerce that you have had with Troy</A><br>
<A NAME=216>As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;</A><br>
<A NAME=217>And better would it fit Achilles much</A><br>
<A NAME=218>To throw down Hector than Polyxena:</A><br>
<A NAME=219>But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,</A><br>
<A NAME=220>When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,</A><br>
<A NAME=221>And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,</A><br>
