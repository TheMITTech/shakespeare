<A NAME=speech1><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Princes,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?</A><br>
<A NAME=3>The ample proposition that hope makes</A><br>
<A NAME=4>In all designs begun on earth below</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Infect the sound pine and divert his grain</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Tortive and errant from his course of growth.</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Nor, princes, is it matter new to us</A><br>
<A NAME=11>That we come short of our suppose so far</A><br>
<A NAME=12>That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Sith every action that hath gone before,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Whereof we have record, trial did draw</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>And that unbodied figure of the thought</A><br>
<A NAME=17>That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>And call them shames? which are indeed nought else</A><br>
<A NAME=20>But the protractive trials of great Jove</A><br>
<A NAME=21>To find persistive constancy in men:</A><br>
<A NAME=22>The fineness of which metal is not found</A><br>
<A NAME=23>In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>The wise and fool, the artist and unread,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:</A><br>
<A NAME=26>But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Puffing at all, winnows the light away;</A><br>
<A NAME=29>And what hath mass or matter, by itself</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>With due observance of thy godlike seat,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>How many shallow bauble boats dare sail</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Upon her patient breast, making their way</A><br>
<A NAME=37>With those of nobler bulk!</A><br>
<A NAME=38>But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage</A><br>
<A NAME=39>The gentle Thetis, and anon behold</A><br>
<A NAME=40>The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Bounding between the two moist elements,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide</A><br>
<A NAME=47>In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness</A><br>
<A NAME=48>The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage</A><br>
<A NAME=52>As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>And with an accent tuned in selfsame key</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Retorts to chiding fortune.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>Agamemnon,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.</A><br>
<A NAME=58>In whom the tempers and the minds of all</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Besides the applause and approbation To which,</A><br>
<p><i>To AGAMEMNON</i></p>
<A NAME=61>most mighty for thy place and sway,</A><br>
<p><i>To NESTOR</i></p>
<A NAME=62>And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life</A><br>
<A NAME=63>I give to both your speeches, which were such</A><br>
<A NAME=64>As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Should hold up high in brass, and such again</A><br>
<A NAME=66>As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree</A><br>
<A NAME=68>On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears</A><br>
<A NAME=69>To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>AGAMEMNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect</A><br>
<A NAME=72>That matter needless, of importless burden,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Divide thy lips, than we are confident,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>We shall hear music, wit and oracle.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>But for these instances.</A><br>
<A NAME=79>The specialty of rule hath been neglected:</A><br>
<A NAME=80>And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.</A><br>
<A NAME=82>When that the general is not like the hive</A><br>
<A NAME=83>To whom the foragers shall all repair,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.</A><br>
<A NAME=86>The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Observe degree, priority and place,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Office and custom, in all line of order;</A><br>
<A NAME=90>And therefore is the glorious planet Sol</A><br>
<A NAME=91>In noble eminence enthroned and sphered</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>And posts, like the commandment of a king,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets</A><br>
<A NAME=96>In evil mixture to disorder wander,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!</A><br>
<A NAME=98>What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Divert and crack, rend and deracinate</A><br>
<A NAME=101>The unity and married calm of states</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Which is the ladder to all high designs,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>The primogenitive and due of birth,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>But by degree, stand in authentic place?</A><br>
<A NAME=110>Take but degree away, untune that string,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets</A><br>
<A NAME=112>In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores</A><br>
<A NAME=114>And make a sop of all this solid globe:</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Strength should be lord of imbecility,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>And the rude son should strike his father dead:</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,</A><br>
<A NAME=118>Between whose endless jar justice resides,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Should lose their names, and so should justice too.</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Then every thing includes itself in power,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Power into will, will into appetite;</A><br>
<A NAME=122>And appetite, an universal wolf,</A><br>
<A NAME=123>So doubly seconded with will and power,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Must make perforce an universal prey,</A><br>
<A NAME=125>And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>This chaos, when degree is suffocate,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Follows the choking.</A><br>
<A NAME=128>And this neglection of degree it is</A><br>
<A NAME=129>That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose</A><br>
<A NAME=130>It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd</A><br>
<A NAME=131>By him one step below, he by the next,</A><br>
<A NAME=132>That next by him beneath; so every step,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Exampled by the first pace that is sick</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Of his superior, grows to an envious fever</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Of pale and bloodless emulation:</A><br>
<A NAME=136>And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd</A><br>
<A NAME=140>The fever whereof all our power is sick.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,</A><br>
<A NAME=142>What is the remedy?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns</A><br>
<A NAME=144>The sinew and the forehand of our host,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Having his ear full of his airy fame,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Upon a lazy bed the livelong day</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Breaks scurril jests;</A><br>
<A NAME=150>And with ridiculous and awkward action,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,</A><br>
<A NAME=152>He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Thy topless deputation he puts on,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>And, like a strutting player, whose conceit</A><br>
<A NAME=155>Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich</A><br>
<A NAME=156>To hear the wooden dialogue and sound</A><br>
<A NAME=157>'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming</A><br>
<A NAME=159>He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,</A><br>
<A NAME=160>'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff</A><br>
<A NAME=163>The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;</A><br>
<A NAME=165>Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>As he being drest to some oration.'</A><br>
<A NAME=168>That's done, as near as the extremest ends</A><br>
<A NAME=169>Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!</A><br>
<A NAME=171>'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,</A><br>
<A NAME=172>Arming to answer in a night alarm.'</A><br>
<A NAME=173>And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age</A><br>
<A NAME=174>Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,</A><br>
<A NAME=175>And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,</A><br>
<A NAME=176>Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport</A><br>
<A NAME=177>Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;</A><br>
<A NAME=178>Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all</A><br>
<A NAME=179>In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,</A><br>
<A NAME=180>All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,</A><br>
<A NAME=181>Severals and generals of grace exact,</A><br>
<A NAME=182>Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,</A><br>
<A NAME=183>Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,</A><br>
<A NAME=184>Success or loss, what is or is not, serves</A><br>
<A NAME=185>As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=186>And in the imitation of these twain--</A><br>
<A NAME=187>Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns</A><br>
<A NAME=188>With an imperial voice--many are infect.</A><br>
<A NAME=189>Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head</A><br>
<A NAME=190>In such a rein, in full as proud a place</A><br>
<A NAME=191>As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,</A><br>
<A NAME=193>Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,</A><br>
<A NAME=194>A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,</A><br>
<A NAME=195>To match us in comparisons with dirt,</A><br>
<A NAME=196>To weaken and discredit our exposure,</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=198>They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,</A><br>
<A NAME=199>Count wisdom as no member of the war,</A><br>
<A NAME=200>Forestall prescience, and esteem no act</A><br>
<A NAME=201>But that of hand: the still and mental parts,</A><br>
<A NAME=202>That do contrive how many hands shall strike,</A><br>
<A NAME=203>When fitness calls them on, and know by measure</A><br>
<A NAME=204>Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:</A><br>
<A NAME=206>They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;</A><br>
<A NAME=207>So that the ram that batters down the wall,</A><br>
<A NAME=208>For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,</A><br>
<A NAME=209>They place before his hand that made the engine,</A><br>
<A NAME=210>Or those that with the fineness of their souls</A><br>
<A NAME=211>By reason guide his execution.</A><br>

<A NAME=297>Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man</A><br>
<A NAME=298>When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;</A><br>

<A NAME=302>I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver</A><br>

<A NAME=speech40><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=320>What is't?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=321>This 'tis:</A><br>
<A NAME=322>Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride</A><br>
<A NAME=323>That hath to this maturity blown up</A><br>
<A NAME=324>In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=325>Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,</A><br>
<A NAME=326>To overbulk us all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=327>Well, and how?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=328>This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,</A><br>
<A NAME=329>However it is spread in general name,</A><br>
<A NAME=330>Relates in purpose only to Achilles.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=331>The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,</A><br>
<A NAME=332>Whose grossness little characters sum up:</A><br>
<A NAME=333>And, in the publication, make no strain,</A><br>
<A NAME=334>But that Achilles, were his brain as barren</A><br>
<A NAME=335>As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,</A><br>
<A NAME=336>'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,</A><br>
<A NAME=337>Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose</A><br>
<A NAME=338>Pointing on him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=339>And wake him to the answer, think you?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>NESTOR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=340>Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,</A><br>
<A NAME=341>That can from Hector bring his honour off,</A><br>
<A NAME=342>If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,</A><br>
<A NAME=343>Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;</A><br>
<A NAME=344>For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute</A><br>
<A NAME=345>With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,</A><br>
<A NAME=346>Our imputation shall be oddly poised</A><br>
<A NAME=347>In this wild action; for the success,</A><br>
<A NAME=348>Although particular, shall give a scantling</A><br>
<A NAME=349>Of good or bad unto the general;</A><br>
<A NAME=350>And in such indexes, although small pricks</A><br>
<A NAME=351>To their subsequent volumes, there is seen</A><br>
<A NAME=352>The baby figure of the giant mass</A><br>
<A NAME=353>Of things to come at large. It is supposed</A><br>
<A NAME=354>He that meets Hector issues from our choice</A><br>
<A NAME=355>And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,</A><br>
<A NAME=356>Makes merit her election, and doth boil,</A><br>
<A NAME=357>As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd</A><br>
<A NAME=358>Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,</A><br>
<A NAME=359>What heart receives from hence the conquering part,</A><br>
<A NAME=360>To steel a strong opinion to themselves?</A><br>
<A NAME=361>Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,</A><br>
<A NAME=362>In no less working than are swords and bows</A><br>
<A NAME=363>Directive by the limbs.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech47><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=364>Give pardon to my speech:</A><br>
<A NAME=365>Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.</A><br>
<A NAME=366>Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,</A><br>
<A NAME=367>And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,</A><br>
<A NAME=368>The lustre of the better yet to show,</A><br>
<A NAME=369>Shall show the better. Do not consent</A><br>
<A NAME=370>That ever Hector and Achilles meet;</A><br>
<A NAME=371>For both our honour and our shame in this</A><br>
<A NAME=372>Are dogg'd with two strange followers.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech49><b>ULYSSES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=374>What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,</A><br>
<A NAME=375>Were he not proud, we all should share with him:</A><br>
<A NAME=376>But he already is too insolent;</A><br>
<A NAME=377>A nd we were better parch in Afric sun</A><br>
<A NAME=378>Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=379>Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=380>Why then, we did our main opinion crush</A><br>
<A NAME=381>In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;</A><br>
<A NAME=382>And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw</A><br>
<A NAME=383>The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves</A><br>
<A NAME=384>Give him allowance for the better man;</A><br>
<A NAME=385>For that will physic the great Myrmidon</A><br>
<A NAME=386>Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall</A><br>
<A NAME=387>His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.</A><br>
<A NAME=388>If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,</A><br>
<A NAME=389>We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,</A><br>
<A NAME=390>Yet go we under our opinion still</A><br>
<A NAME=391>That we have better men. But, hit or miss,</A><br>
<A NAME=392>Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:</A><br>
<A NAME=393>Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.</A><br>

<A NAME=396>And I will give a taste of it forthwith</A><br>
