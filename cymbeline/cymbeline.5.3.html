<H3>SCENE III. Another part of the field.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Camest thou from where they made the stand?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>I did.</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>I did.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>But that the heavens fought: the king himself</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Of his wings destitute, the army broken,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work</A><br>
<A NAME=11>More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd</A><br>
<A NAME=14>With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living</A><br>
<A NAME=15>To die with lengthen'd shame.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=16>Where was this lane?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>An honest one, I warrant; who deserved</A><br>
<A NAME=20>So long a breeding as his white beard came to,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>He, with two striplings-lads more like to run</A><br>
<A NAME=23>The country base than to commit such slaughter</A><br>
<A NAME=24>With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Than those for preservation cased, or shame--</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:</A><br>
<A NAME=28>To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Or we are Romans and will give you that</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'</A><br>
<A NAME=32>These three,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Three thousand confident, in act as many--</A><br>
<A NAME=34>For three performers are the file when all</A><br>
<A NAME=35>The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Accommodated by the place, more charming</A><br>
<A NAME=37>With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd</A><br>
<A NAME=38>A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>turn'd coward</A><br>
<A NAME=41>But by example--O, a sin in war,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look</A><br>
<A NAME=43>The way that they did, and to grin like lions</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began</A><br>
<A NAME=45>A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon</A><br>
<A NAME=46>A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Like fragments in hard voyages, became</A><br>
<A NAME=50>The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Some slain before; some dying; some their friends</A><br>
<A NAME=53>O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Those that would die or ere resist are grown</A><br>
<A NAME=56>The mortal bugs o' the field.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>This was strange chance</A><br>
<A NAME=58>A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Rather to wonder at the things you hear</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:</A><br>
<A NAME=63>'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>Nay, be not angry, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>'Lack, to what end?</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;</A><br>
<A NAME=68>For if he'll do as he is made to do,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.</A><br>
<A NAME=70>You have put me into rhyme.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>Farewell; you're angry.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=72>Still going?</A><br>
<p><i>Exit Lord</i></p>
<A NAME=73>This is a lord! O noble misery,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!</A><br>
<A NAME=75>To-day how many would have given their honours</A><br>
<A NAME=76>To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Could not find death where I did hear him groan,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we</A><br>
<A NAME=82>That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him</A><br>
<A NAME=83>For being now a favourer to the Briton,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>No more a Briton, I have resumed again</A><br>
<A NAME=85>The part I came in: fight I will no more,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>But yield me to the veriest hind that shall</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Here made by the Roman; great the answer be</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;</A><br>
<A NAME=90>On either side I come to spend my breath;</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>But end it by some means for Imogen.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter two British Captains and Soldiers</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>First Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.</A><br>
<A NAME=94>'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Second Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>That gave the affront with them.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>So 'tis reported:</A><br>
<A NAME=98>But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>POSTHUMUS LEONATUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>A Roman,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Had answer'd him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Second Captain</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>                  Lay hands on him; a dog!</A><br>
<A NAME=103>A leg of Rome shall not return to tell</A><br>
<A NAME=104>What crows have peck'd them here. He brags</A><br>
<A NAME=105>his service</A><br>
<A NAME=106>As if he were of note: bring him to the king.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,  PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.  The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to  CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler: then exeunt omnes</i></p>
