<A NAME=0.0.1>Open your ears; for which of you will stop</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.2>The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.3>I, from the orient to the drooping west,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.4>Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.5>The acts commenced on this ball of earth:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.6>Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.7>The which in every language I pronounce,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.8>Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.9>I speak of peace, while covert enmity</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.10>Under the smile of safety wounds the world:</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.11>And who but Rumour, who but only I,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.12>Make fearful musters and prepared defence,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.13>Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.14>Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.15>And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.16>Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.17>And of so easy and so plain a stop</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.18>That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.19>The still-discordant wavering multitude,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.20>Can play upon it. But what need I thus</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.21>My well-known body to anatomize</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.22>Among my household? Why is Rumour here?</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.23>I run before King Harry's victory;</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.24>Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.25>Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.26>Quenching the flame of bold rebellion</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.27>Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.28>To speak so true at first? my office is</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.29>To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.30>Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.31>And that the king before the Douglas' rage</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.32>Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.33>This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.34>Between that royal field of Shrewsbury</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.35>And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.36>Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.37>Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.38>And not a man of them brings other news</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.39>Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues</A><br>
<A NAME=0.0.40>They bring smooth comforts false, worse than</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.20>And, in the fortune of my lord your son,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.21>Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.22>Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.23>And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.24>And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.41>With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.42>Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.43>A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.44>That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.45>He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.46>I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.47>He told me that rebellion had bad luck</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.48>And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.49>With that, he gave his able horse the head,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.50>And bending forward struck his armed heels</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.51>Against the panting sides of his poor jade</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.52>Up to the rowel-head, and starting so</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.53>He seem'd in running to devour the way,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.54>Staying no longer question.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.63>Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.64>Give then such instances of loss?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>LORD BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.65>Who, he?</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.66>He was some hilding fellow that had stolen</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.67>The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.68>Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter MORTON</i></p>

<A NAME=speech20><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1.1.69>Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.70>Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.72>Hath left a witness'd usurpation.</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.81>So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.82>Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.100>And I will take it as a sweet disgrace</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.101>And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.119>Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.120>To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.126>From the best temper'd courage in his troops;</A><br>

<A NAME=1.1.135>Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,</A><br>
<A NAME=1.1.136>Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester</A><br>

<A NAME=5.5.112>My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.113>and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.114>for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.115>to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.116>should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.117>But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.118>known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.119>in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.120>patience for it and to promise you a better. I</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.121>meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.122>ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.123>you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.124>I would be and here I commit my body to your</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.125>mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.126>as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.127>If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.128>you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.129>light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.130>good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.131>and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.132>forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.133>gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.134>was never seen before in such an assembly.</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.135>One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.136>much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.137>continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.138>you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.139>any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.140>unless already a' be killed with your hard</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.141>opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.142>not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.143>too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down</A><br>
<A NAME=5.5.144>before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.</A><br>
