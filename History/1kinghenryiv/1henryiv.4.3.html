<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>We'll fight with him to-night.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>EARL OF WORCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>It may not be.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>EARL OF DOUGLAS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>You give him then the advantage.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>VERNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>Not a whit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Why say you so? looks he not for supply?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>VERNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>So do we.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>        His is certain, ours is doubtful.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>EARL OF WORCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>VERNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>Do not, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>EARL OF DOUGLAS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>                  You do not counsel well:</A><br>
<A NAME=11>You speak it out of fear and cold heart.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>VERNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>And I dare well maintain it with my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>If well-respected honour bid me on,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>I hold as little counsel with weak fear</A><br>
<A NAME=16>As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Which of us fears.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>EARL OF DOUGLAS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>                  Yea, or to-night.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>VERNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>Content.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>To-night, say I.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>VERNON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=22>Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Being men of such great leading as you are,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>That you foresee not what impediments</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Drag back our expedition: certain horse</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And now their pride and mettle is asleep,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>That not a horse is half the half of himself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>So are the horses of the enemy</A><br>
<A NAME=32>In general, journey-bated and brought low:</A><br>
<A NAME=33>The better part of ours are full of rest.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>EARL OF WORCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=34>The number of the king exceedeth ours:</A><br>
<A NAME=35>For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.</A><br>
<p><i>The trumpet sounds a parley</i></p>
<p><i>Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>SIR WALTER BLUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>I come with gracious offers from the king,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God</A><br>
<A NAME=39>You were of our determination!</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Some of us love you well; and even those some</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Envy your great deservings and good name,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Because you are not of our quality,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>But stand against us like an enemy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>SIR WALTER BLUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=44>And God defend but still I should stand so,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>So long as out of limit and true rule</A><br>
<A NAME=46>You stand against anointed majesty.</A><br>
<A NAME=47>But to my charge. The king hath sent to know</A><br>
<A NAME=48>The nature of your griefs, and whereupon</A><br>
<A NAME=49>You conjure from the breast of civil peace</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Audacious cruelty. If that the king</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Have any way your good deserts forgot,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Which he confesseth to be manifold,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed</A><br>
<A NAME=55>You shall have your desires with interest</A><br>
<A NAME=56>And pardon absolute for yourself and these</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Herein misled by your suggestion.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>The king is kind; and well we know the king</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.</A><br>
<A NAME=60>My father and my uncle and myself</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Did give him that same royalty he wears;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And when he was not six and twenty strong,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>My father gave him welcome to the shore;</A><br>
<A NAME=66>And when he heard him swear and vow to God</A><br>
<A NAME=67>He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>To sue his livery and beg his peace,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>My father, in kind heart and pity moved,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Now when the lords and barons of the realm</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>The more and less came in with cap and knee;</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Even at the heels in golden multitudes.</A><br>
<A NAME=80>He presently, as greatness knows itself,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Steps me a little higher than his vow</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Made to my father, while his blood was poor,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;</A><br>
<A NAME=84>And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Some certain edicts and some strait decrees</A><br>
<A NAME=86>That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>This seeming brow of justice, did he win</A><br>
<A NAME=90>The hearts of all that he did angle for;</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Proceeded further; cut me off the heads</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Of all the favourites that the absent king</A><br>
<A NAME=93>In deputation left behind him here,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>When he was personal in the Irish war.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>SIR WALTER BLUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>Tut, I came not to hear this.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Then to the point.</A><br>
<A NAME=97>In short time after, he deposed the king;</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Soon after that, deprived him of his life;</A><br>
<A NAME=99>And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:</A><br>
<A NAME=100>To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Who is, if every owner were well placed,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>There without ransom to lie forfeited;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Disgraced me in my happy victories,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Sought to entrap me by intelligence;</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Rated mine uncle from the council-board;</A><br>
<A NAME=107>In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>And in conclusion drove us to seek out</A><br>
<A NAME=110>This head of safety; and withal to pry</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Into his title, the which we find</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Too indirect for long continuance.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>SIR WALTER BLUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>Shall I return this answer to the king?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Some surety for a safe return again,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>And in the morning early shall my uncle</A><br>
<A NAME=118>Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>SIR WALTER BLUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>I would you would accept of grace and love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>HOTSPUR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=120>And may be so we shall.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>SIR WALTER BLUNT</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=121>Pray God you do.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
