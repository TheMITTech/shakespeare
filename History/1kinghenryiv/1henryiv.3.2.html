<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>For we shall presently have need of you.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Lords</i></p>
<A NAME=4>I know not whether God will have it so,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>For some displeasing service I have done,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>That, in his secret doom, out of my blood</A><br>
<A NAME=7>He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;</A><br>
<A NAME=8>But thou dost in thy passages of life</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Make me believe that thou art only mark'd</A><br>
<A NAME=10>For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven</A><br>
<A NAME=11>To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Could such inordinate and low desires,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Such barren pleasures, rude society,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Accompany the greatness of thy blood</A><br>
<A NAME=17>And hold their level with thy princely heart?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>So please your majesty, I would I could</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Quit all offences with as clear excuse</A><br>
<A NAME=20>As well as I am doubtless I can purge</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Myself of many I am charged withal:</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Yet such extenuation let me beg,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>As, in reproof of many tales devised,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>I may, for some things true, wherein my youth</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Find pardon on my true submission.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>At thy affections, which do hold a wing</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Which by thy younger brother is supplied,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>And art almost an alien to the hearts</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Of all the court and princes of my blood:</A><br>
<A NAME=36>The hope and expectation of thy time</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Had I so lavish of my presence been,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>So stale and cheap to vulgar company,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Opinion, that did help me to the crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Had still kept loyal to possession</A><br>
<A NAME=44>And left me in reputeless banishment,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.</A><br>
<A NAME=46>By being seldom seen, I could not stir</A><br>
<A NAME=47>But like a comet I was wonder'd at;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>That men would tell their children 'This is he;'</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'</A><br>
<A NAME=50>And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And dress'd myself in such humility</A><br>
<A NAME=52>That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Even in the presence of the crowned king.</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;</A><br>
<A NAME=56>My presence, like a robe pontifical,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast</A><br>
<A NAME=59>And won by rareness such solemnity.</A><br>
<A NAME=60>The skipping king, he ambled up and down</A><br>
<A NAME=61>With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Mingled his royalty with capering fools,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Had his great name profaned with their scorns</A><br>
<A NAME=65>And gave his countenance, against his name,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Of every beardless vain comparative,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Grew a companion to the common streets,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;</A><br>
<A NAME=70>That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>They surfeited with honey and began</A><br>
<A NAME=72>To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little</A><br>
<A NAME=73>More than a little is by much too much.</A><br>
<A NAME=74>So when he had occasion to be seen,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>He was but as the cuckoo is in June,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=77>As, sick and blunted with community,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Afford no extraordinary gaze,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Such as is bent on sun-like majesty</A><br>
<A NAME=80>When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;</A><br>
<A NAME=81>But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Slept in his face and render'd such aspect</A><br>
<A NAME=83>As cloudy men use to their adversaries,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.</A><br>
<A NAME=85>And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;</A><br>
<A NAME=86>For thou has lost thy princely privilege</A><br>
<A NAME=87>With vile participation: not an eye</A><br>
<A NAME=88>But is a-weary of thy common sight,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Which now doth that I would not have it do,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Be more myself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=94>                  For all the world</A><br>
<A NAME=95>As thou art to this hour was Richard then</A><br>
<A NAME=96>When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>And even as I was then is Percy now.</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>He hath more worthy interest to the state</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Than thou the shadow of succession;</A><br>
<A NAME=101>For of no right, nor colour like to right,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And, being no more in debt to years than thou,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on</A><br>
<A NAME=106>To bloody battles and to bruising arms.</A><br>
<A NAME=107>What never-dying honour hath he got</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Whose hot incursions and great name in arms</A><br>
<A NAME=110>Holds from all soldiers chief majority</A><br>
<A NAME=111>And military title capital</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>This infant warrior, in his enterprises</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Enlarged him and made a friend of him,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>To fill the mouth of deep defiance up</A><br>
<A NAME=118>And shake the peace and safety of our throne.</A><br>
<A NAME=119>And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Capitulate against us and are up.</A><br>
<A NAME=122>But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>Base inclination and the start of spleen</A><br>
<A NAME=127>To fight against me under Percy's pay,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>To show how much thou art degenerate.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=130>Do not think so; you shall not find it so:</A><br>
<A NAME=131>And God forgive them that so much have sway'd</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!</A><br>
<A NAME=133>I will redeem all this on Percy's head</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And in the closing of some glorious day</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Be bold to tell you that I am your son;</A><br>
<A NAME=136>When I will wear a garment all of blood</A><br>
<A NAME=137>And stain my favours in a bloody mask,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:</A><br>
<A NAME=139>And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,</A><br>
<A NAME=140>That this same child of honour and renown,</A><br>
<A NAME=141>This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,</A><br>
<A NAME=142>And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.</A><br>
<A NAME=143>For every honour sitting on his helm,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Would they were multitudes, and on my head</A><br>
<A NAME=145>My shames redoubled! for the time will come,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>That I shall make this northern youth exchange</A><br>
<A NAME=147>His glorious deeds for my indignities.</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Percy is but my factor, good my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=149>To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;</A><br>
<A NAME=150>And I will call him to so strict account,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>That he shall render every glory up,</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.</A><br>
<A NAME=154>This, in the name of God, I promise here:</A><br>
<A NAME=155>The which if He be pleased I shall perform,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>I do beseech your majesty may salve</A><br>
<A NAME=157>The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:</A><br>
<A NAME=158>If not, the end of life cancels all bands;</A><br>
<A NAME=159>And I will die a hundred thousand deaths</A><br>
<A NAME=160>Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.</A><br>

<A NAME=166>That Douglas and the English rebels met</A><br>

<A NAME=281>and had my pocket picked: this house is turned</A><br>
<A NAME=282>bawdy-house; they pick pockets.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=283>What didst thou lose, Jack?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=284>Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of</A><br>
<A NAME=285>forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my</A><br>
<A NAME=286>grandfather's.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=287>A trifle, some eight-penny matter.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=288>So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your</A><br>

<A NAME=290>of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=293>There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=294>There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed</A><br>
<A NAME=295>prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn</A><br>
<A NAME=296>fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the</A><br>
<A NAME=297>deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,</A><br>
<A NAME=298>go</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=300>What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=301>I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=305>Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say</A><br>

<A NAME=307>Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech51><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=308>What beast! why, an otter.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=309>An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=310>Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not</A><br>
<A NAME=311>where to have her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=312>Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=314>Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=315>So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=317>Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech58><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=318>A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth</A><br>
<A NAME=319>a million: thou owest me thy love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech59><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=320>Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would</A><br>
<A NAME=321>cudgel you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=322>Did I, Bardolph?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=323>Indeed, Sir John, you said so.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech62><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=324>Yea, if he said my ring was copper.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech63><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=325>I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech64><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=326>Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:</A><br>
<A NAME=327>but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the</A><br>
<A NAME=328>roaring of a lion's whelp.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech65><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=329>And why not as the lion?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech66><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=330>The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou</A><br>
<A NAME=331>think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an</A><br>
<A NAME=332>I do, I pray God my girdle break.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech67><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=333>O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy</A><br>
<A NAME=334>knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,</A><br>
<A NAME=335>truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all</A><br>
<A NAME=336>filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest</A><br>
<A NAME=337>woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,</A><br>
<A NAME=338>impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in</A><br>
<A NAME=339>thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of</A><br>
<A NAME=340>bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of</A><br>
<A NAME=341>sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket</A><br>
<A NAME=342>were enriched with any other injuries but these, I</A><br>
<A NAME=343>am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will</A><br>
<A NAME=344>not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech68><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=345>Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of</A><br>

<A NAME=347>Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I</A><br>
<A NAME=348>have more flesh than another man, and therefore more</A><br>
<A NAME=349>frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech69><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=350>It appears so by the story.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech70><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
