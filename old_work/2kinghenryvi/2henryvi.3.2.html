<A NAME=40>What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Came he right now to sing a raven's note,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;</A><br>
<A NAME=43>And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>By crying comfort from a hollow breast,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Can chase away the first-conceived sound?</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;</A><br>
<A NAME=55>For in the shade of death I shall find joy;</A><br>
<A NAME=56>In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Although the duke was enemy to him,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:</A><br>
<A NAME=60>And for myself, foe as he was to me,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>And all to have the noble duke alive.</A><br>
<A NAME=66>What know I how the world may deem of me?</A><br>
<A NAME=67>For it is known we were but hollow friends:</A><br>
<A NAME=68>It may be judged I made the duke away;</A><br>
<A NAME=69>So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.</A><br>
<A NAME=71>This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!</A><br>
<A NAME=72>To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=74>Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.</A><br>
<A NAME=75>What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?</A><br>
<A NAME=76>I am no loathsome leper; look on me.</A><br>
<A NAME=77>What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Erect his statue and worship it,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>And make my image but an alehouse sign.</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea</A><br>
<A NAME=84>And twice by awkward wind from England's bank</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Drove back again unto my native clime?</A><br>
<A NAME=86>What boded this, but well forewarning wind</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?</A><br>
<A NAME=89>What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts</A><br>
<A NAME=90>And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:</A><br>
<A NAME=91>And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>But left that hateful office unto thee:</A><br>
<A NAME=95>The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:</A><br>
<A NAME=98>The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands</A><br>
<A NAME=99>And would not dash me with their ragged sides,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Might in thy palace perish Margaret.</A><br>
<A NAME=102>As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>I stood upon the hatches in the storm,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>And when the dusky sky began to rob</A><br>
<A NAME=106>My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>I took a costly jewel from my neck,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:</A><br>
<A NAME=111>And even with this I lost fair England's view</A><br>
<A NAME=112>And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart</A><br>
<A NAME=113>And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.</A><br>
<A NAME=115>How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>The agent of thy foul inconstancy,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did</A><br>
<A NAME=118>When he to madding Dido would unfold</A><br>
<A NAME=119>His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!</A><br>
<A NAME=122>For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=161>See how the blood is settled in his face.</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Being all descended to the labouring heart;</A><br>
<A NAME=165>Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;</A><br>
<A NAME=167>Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth</A><br>
<A NAME=168>To blush and beautify the cheek again.</A><br>
<A NAME=169>But see, his face is black and full of blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=170>His eye-balls further out than when he lived,</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;</A><br>
<A NAME=172>His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;</A><br>
<A NAME=173>His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd</A><br>
<A NAME=174>And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:</A><br>
<A NAME=175>Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;</A><br>
<A NAME=176>His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,</A><br>
<A NAME=177>Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.</A><br>
<A NAME=178>It cannot be but he was murder'd here;</A><br>
