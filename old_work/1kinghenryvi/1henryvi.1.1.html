<h3>SCENE I. Westminster Abbey.</H3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the  Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of  France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds,  & c</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Comets, importing change of times and states,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>And with them scourge the bad revolting stars</A><br>
<A NAME=5>That have consented unto Henry's death!</A><br>
<A NAME=6>King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!</A><br>
<A NAME=7>England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>England ne'er had a king until his time.</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Virtue he had, deserving to command:</A><br>
<A NAME=10>His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:</A><br>
<A NAME=11>His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;</A><br>
<A NAME=12>His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>More dazzled and drove back his enemies</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.</A><br>
<A NAME=15>What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:</A><br>
<A NAME=16>He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Henry is dead and never shall revive:</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Upon a wooden coffin we attend,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>And death's dishonourable victory</A><br>
<A NAME=21>We with our stately presence glorify,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Like captives bound to a triumphant car.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>What! shall we curse the planets of mishap</A><br>
<A NAME=24>That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Or shall we think the subtle-witted French</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him</A><br>
<A NAME=27>By magic verses have contrived his end?</A><br>
<A NAME=28>BISHOP</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>OF WINCHESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day</A><br>
<A NAME=31>So dreadful will not be as was his sight.</A><br>
<A NAME=32>The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:</A><br>
<A NAME=33>The church's prayers made him so prosperous.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=34>The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:</A><br>
<A NAME=36>None do you like but an effeminate prince,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.</A><br>
<A NAME=38>BISHOP</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>OF WINCHESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector</A><br>
<A NAME=40>And lookest to command the prince and realm.</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>More than God or religious churchmen may.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Except it be to pray against thy foes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Posterity, await for wretched years,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>And none but women left to wail the dead.</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!</A><br>
<A NAME=57>A far more glorious star thy soul will make</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Than Julius Caesar or bright--</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>My honourable lords, health to you all!</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?</A><br>
<A NAME=68>If Henry were recall'd to life again,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>How were they lost? what treachery was used?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>No treachery; but want of men and money.</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>That here you maintain several factions,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>You are disputing of your generals:</A><br>
<A NAME=76>One would have lingering wars with little cost;</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;</A><br>
<A NAME=78>A third thinks, without expense at all,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Awake, awake, English nobility!</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Of England's coat one half is cut away.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>Were our tears wanting to this funeral,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=86>Me they concern; Regent I am of France.</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>To weep their intermissive miseries.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter to them another Messenger</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.</A><br>
<A NAME=92>France is revolted from the English quite,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Except some petty towns of no import:</A><br>
<A NAME=94>The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;</A><br>
<A NAME=95>The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;</A><br>
<A NAME=97>The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!</A><br>
<A NAME=99>O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?</A><br>
<A NAME=103>An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Wherewith already France is overrun.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter another Messenger</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=105>My gracious lords, to add to your laments,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>I must inform you of a dismal fight</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.</A><br>
<A NAME=109>BISHOP</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>OF WINCHESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=110>What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=111>O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:</A><br>
<A NAME=112>The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.</A><br>
<A NAME=113>The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>Retiring from the siege of Orleans,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.</A><br>
<A NAME=116>By three and twenty thousand of the French</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Was round encompassed and set upon.</A><br>
<A NAME=118>No leisure had he to enrank his men;</A><br>
<A NAME=119>He wanted pikes to set before his archers;</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges</A><br>
<A NAME=121>They pitched in the ground confusedly,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.</A><br>
<A NAME=123>More than three hours the fight continued;</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Where valiant Talbot above human thought</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:</A><br>
<A NAME=126>Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:</A><br>
<A NAME=128>The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;</A><br>
<A NAME=129>All the whole army stood agazed on him:</A><br>
<A NAME=130>His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit</A><br>
<A NAME=131>A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain</A><br>
<A NAME=132>And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:</A><br>
<A NAME=135>He, being in the vaward, placed behind</A><br>
<A NAME=136>With purpose to relieve and follow them,</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;</A><br>
<A NAME=139>Enclosed were they with their enemies:</A><br>
<A NAME=140>A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Whom all France with their chief assembled strength</A><br>
<A NAME=143>Durst not presume to look once in the face.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>For living idly here in pomp and ease,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=148>O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,</A><br>
<A NAME=149>And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=151>His ransom there is none but I shall pay:</A><br>
<A NAME=152>I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:</A><br>
<A NAME=153>His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.</A><br>
<A NAME=155>Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;</A><br>
<A NAME=156>Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=160>So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;</A><br>
<A NAME=161>The English army is grown weak and faint:</A><br>
<A NAME=162>The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=165>Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>BEDFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=168>I do remember it; and here take my leave,</A><br>
<A NAME=169>To go about my preparation.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=170>I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,</A><br>
<A NAME=171>To view the artillery and munition;</A><br>
<A NAME=172>And then I will proclaim young Henry king.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=173>To Eltham will I, where the young king is,</A><br>
<A NAME=174>Being ordain'd his special governor,</A><br>
<A NAME=175>And for his safety there I'll best devise.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
<A NAME=176>BISHOP</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>OF WINCHESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=177>Each hath his place and function to attend:</A><br>
<A NAME=178>I am left out; for me nothing remains.</A><br>
<A NAME=179>But long I will not be Jack out of office:</A><br>
<A NAME=180>The king from Eltham I intend to steal</A><br>
<A NAME=181>And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
