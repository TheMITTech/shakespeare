<H3>SCENE II. Before York.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,  PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with drum and trumpets</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy</A><br>
<A NAME=3>That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:</A><br>
<A NAME=6>To see this sight, it irks my very soul.</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>My gracious liege, this too much lenity</A><br>
<A NAME=10>And harmful pity must be laid aside.</A><br>
<A NAME=11>To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Not to the beast that would usurp their den.</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Not his that spoils her young before her face.</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Not he that sets his foot upon her back.</A><br>
<A NAME=17>The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:</A><br>
<A NAME=21>He, but a duke, would have his son a king,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>And raise his issue, like a loving sire;</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Didst yield consent to disinherit him,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Which argued thee a most unloving father.</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Unreasonable creatures feed their young;</A><br>
<A NAME=27>And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Yet, in protection of their tender ones,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Who hath not seen them, even with those wings</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Offer their own lives in their young's defence?</A><br>
<A NAME=33>For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Were it not pity that this goodly boy</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>And long hereafter say unto his child,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got</A><br>
<A NAME=38>My careless father fondly gave away'?</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;</A><br>
<A NAME=40>And let his manly face, which promiseth</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart</A><br>
<A NAME=42>To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Inferring arguments of mighty force.</A><br>
<A NAME=45>But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear</A><br>
<A NAME=46>That things ill-got had ever bad success?</A><br>
<A NAME=47>And happy always was it for that son</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?</A><br>
<A NAME=49>I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;</A><br>
<A NAME=50>And would my father had left me no more!</A><br>
<A NAME=51>For all the rest is held at such a rate</A><br>
<A NAME=52>As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Than in possession and jot of pleasure.</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know</A><br>
<A NAME=55>How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>And this soft courage makes your followers faint.</A><br>
<A NAME=58>You promised knighthood to our forward son:</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Edward, kneel down.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>PRINCE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>My gracious father, by your kingly leave,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>And in that quarrel use it to the death.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>Messenger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Royal commanders, be in readiness:</A><br>
<A NAME=68>For with a band of thirty thousand men</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;</A><br>
<A NAME=70>And in the towns, as they do march along,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>I would your highness would depart the field:</A><br>
<A NAME=74>The queen hath best success when you are absent.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Be it with resolution then to fight.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>PRINCE EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>My royal father, cheer these noble lords</A><br>
<A NAME=79>And hearten those that fight in your defence:</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'</A><br>
<p><i>March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>And set thy diadem upon my head;</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>I am his king, and he should bow his knee;</A><br>
<A NAME=88>I was adopted heir by his consent:</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Have caused him, by new act of parliament,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>To blot out me, and put his own son in.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>And reason too:</A><br>
<A NAME=94>Who should succeed the father but the son?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Or any he the proudest of thy sort.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>WARWICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=101>What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?</A><br>
<A NAME=103>When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Your legs did better service than your hands.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>WARWICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=105>Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=106>You said so much before, and yet you fled.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>WARWICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>NORTHUMBERLAND</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=109>Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.</A><br>
<A NAME=110>Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain</A><br>
<A NAME=111>The execution of my big-swoln heart</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;</A><br>
<A NAME=116>But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>KING HENRY VI</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:</A><br>
<A NAME=120>I am a king, and privileged to speak.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>CLIFFORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=121>My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=123>Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:</A><br>
<A NAME=124>By him that made us all, I am resolved</A><br>
<A NAME=125>that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=126>Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?</A><br>
<A NAME=127>A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>WARWICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;</A><br>
<A NAME=130>For York in justice puts his armour on.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>PRINCE EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=131>If that be right which Warwick says is right,</A><br>
<A NAME=132>There is no wrong, but every thing is right.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=133>Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;</A><br>
<A NAME=134>For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;</A><br>
<A NAME=136>But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>RICHARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Whose father bears the title of a king,--</A><br>
<A NAME=141>As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,</A><br>
<A NAME=143>To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>To make this shameless callet know herself.</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Although thy husband may be Menelaus;</A><br>
<A NAME=148>And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd</A><br>
<A NAME=149>By that false woman, as this king by thee.</A><br>
<A NAME=150>His father revell'd in the heart of France,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;</A><br>
<A NAME=152>And had he match'd according to his state,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>He might have kept that glory to this day;</A><br>
<A NAME=154>But when he took a beggar to his bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=155>And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,</A><br>
<A NAME=158>And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.</A><br>
<A NAME=159>For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?</A><br>
<A NAME=160>Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;</A><br>
<A NAME=161>And we, in pity of the gentle king,</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Had slipp'd our claim until another age.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>GEORGE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=163>But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>And that thy summer bred us no increase,</A><br>
<A NAME=165>We set the axe to thy usurping root;</A><br>
<A NAME=166>And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=167>Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,</A><br>
<A NAME=169>Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=170>And, in this resolution, I defy thee;</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Not willing any longer conference,</A><br>
<A NAME=172>Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.</A><br>
<A NAME=173>Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!</A><br>
<A NAME=174>And either victory, or else a grave.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=175>Stay, Edward.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>EDWARD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=176>No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:</A><br>
<A NAME=177>These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
