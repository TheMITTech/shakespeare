<H3>SCENE III. Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.</H3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two French Lords, with Attendants</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Was made much poorer by it: but your son,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Her estimation home.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>COUNTESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>'Tis past, my liege;</A><br>
<A NAME=6>And I beseech your majesty to make it</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;</A><br>
<A NAME=8>When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>O'erbears it and burns on.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>My honour'd lady,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>I have forgiven and forgotten all;</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Though my revenges were high bent upon him,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>And watch'd the time to shoot.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>LAFEU</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>This I must say,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>But first I beg my pardon, the young lord</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Offence of mighty note; but to himself</A><br>
<A NAME=18>The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Whose beauty did astonish the survey</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Humbly call'd mistress.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>Praising what is lost</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;</A><br>
<A NAME=25>We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill</A><br>
<A NAME=26>All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;</A><br>
<A NAME=27>The nature of his great offence is dead,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And deeper than oblivion we do bury</A><br>
<A NAME=29>The incensing relics of it: let him approach,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>A stranger, no offender; and inform him</A><br>
<A NAME=31>So 'tis our will he should.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>I shall, my liege.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>LAFEU</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=34>All that he is hath reference to your highness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=35>Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me</A><br>
<A NAME=36>That set him high in fame.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BERTRAM</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>LAFEU</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>He looks well on't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>I am not a day of season,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail</A><br>
<A NAME=40>In me at once: but to the brightest beams</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;</A><br>
<A NAME=42>The time is fair again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>My high-repented blames,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Dear sovereign, pardon to me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=45>All is whole;</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Not one word more of the consumed time.</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Let's take the instant by the forward top;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees</A><br>
<A NAME=49>The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Steals ere we can effect them. You remember</A><br>
<A NAME=51>The daughter of this lord?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Admiringly, my liege, at first</A><br>
<A NAME=53>I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Where the impression of mine eye infixing,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Which warp'd the line of every other favour;</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Extended or contracted all proportions</A><br>
<A NAME=60>To a most hideous object: thence it came</A><br>
<A NAME=61>That she whom all men praised and whom myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye</A><br>
<A NAME=63>The dust that did offend it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Well excused:</A><br>
<A NAME=65>That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away</A><br>
<A NAME=66>From the great compt: but love that comes too late,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>To the great sender turns a sour offence,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Make trivial price of serious things we have,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Not knowing them until we know their grave:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Destroy our friends and after weep their dust</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Our own love waking cries to see what's done,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.</A><br>
<A NAME=76>Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:</A><br>
<A NAME=78>The main consents are had; and here we'll stay</A><br>
<A NAME=79>To see our widower's second marriage-day.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>COUNTESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>LAFEU</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Come on, my son, in whom my house's name</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Must be digested, give a favour from you</A><br>
<A NAME=84>To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>That she may quickly come.</A><br>
<p><i>BERTRAM gives a ring</i></p>
<A NAME=86>By my old beard,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>The last that e'er I took her at court,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>I saw upon her finger.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>Hers it was not.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.</A><br>
<A NAME=94>This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Necessitied to help, that by this token</A><br>
<A NAME=97>I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave</A><br>
<A NAME=98>her</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Of what should stead her most?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>My gracious sovereign,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>The ring was never hers.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>COUNTESS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>Son, on my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it</A><br>
<A NAME=105>At her life's rate.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>LAFEU</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=106>I am sure I saw her wear it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:</A><br>
<A NAME=108>In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name</A><br>
<A NAME=110>Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought</A><br>
<A NAME=111>I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed</A><br>
<A NAME=112>To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully</A><br>
<A NAME=113>I could not answer in that course of honour</A><br>
<A NAME=114>As she had made the overture, she ceased</A><br>
<A NAME=115>In heavy satisfaction and would never</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Receive the ring again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>Plutus himself,</A><br>
<A NAME=118>That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Hath not in nature's mystery more science</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know</A><br>
<A NAME=122>That you are well acquainted with yourself,</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement</A><br>
<A NAME=124>You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety</A><br>
<A NAME=125>That she would never put it from her finger,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Where you have never come, or sent it us</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Upon her great disaster.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>She never saw it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=130>Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;</A><br>
<A NAME=131>And makest conjectural fears to come into me</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove</A><br>
<A NAME=133>That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,</A><br>
<A NAME=135>And she is dead; which nothing, but to close</A><br>
<A NAME=136>Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,</A><br>
<A NAME=137>More than to see this ring. Take him away.</A><br>
<p><i>Guards seize BERTRAM</i></p>
<A NAME=138>My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>Shall tax my fears of little vanity,</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!</A><br>
<A NAME=141>We'll sift this matter further.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=142>If you shall prove</A><br>
<A NAME=143>This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Where yet she never was.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit, guarded</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=146>I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Gentleman</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=147>Gracious sovereign,</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Here's a petition from a Florentine,</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Who hath for four or five removes come short</A><br>
<A NAME=151>To tender it herself. I undertook it,</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know</A><br>
<A NAME=154>Is here attending: her business looks in her</A><br>
<A NAME=155>With an importing visage; and she told me,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern</A><br>
<A NAME=157>Your highness with herself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=159>when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won</A><br>
<A NAME=160>me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows</A><br>
<A NAME=161>are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He</A><br>

<A NAME=163>him to his country for justice: grant it me, O</A><br>

<A NAME=speech32><b>KING</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=169>The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,</A><br>
<A NAME=170>To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:</A><br>
