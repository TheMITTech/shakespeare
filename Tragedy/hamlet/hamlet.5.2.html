<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter HAMLET and HORATIO</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;</A><br>
<A NAME=2>You do remember all the circumstance?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Remember it, my lord?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>That would not let me sleep: methought I lay</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>And praised be rashness for it, let us know,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us</A><br>
<A NAME=10>There's a divinity that shapes our ends,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Rough-hew them how we will,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>That is most certain.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>Up from my cabin,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Groped I to find out them; had my desire.</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew</A><br>
<A NAME=17>To mine own room again; making so bold,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>My fears forgetting manners, to unseal</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--</A><br>
<A NAME=20>O royal knavery!--an exact command,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Larded with many several sorts of reasons</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Importing Denmark's health and England's too,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>My head should be struck off.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=27>Is't possible?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.</A><br>
<A NAME=29>But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>I beseech you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>They had begun the play--I sat me down,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:</A><br>
<A NAME=35>I once did hold it, as our statists do,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>A baseness to write fair and labour'd much</A><br>
<A NAME=37>How to forget that learning, but, sir, now</A><br>
<A NAME=38>It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know</A><br>
<A NAME=39>The effect of what I wrote?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Ay, good my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>An earnest conjuration from the king,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>As England was his faithful tributary,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>As love between them like the palm might flourish,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear</A><br>
<A NAME=45>And stand a comma 'tween their amities,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>That, on the view and knowing of these contents,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Without debatement further, more or less,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>He should the bearers put to sudden death,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Not shriving-time allow'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>How was this seal'd?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.</A><br>
<A NAME=53>I had my father's signet in my purse,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Which was the model of that Danish seal;</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Folded the writ up in form of the other,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>The changeling never known. Now, the next day</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Thou know'st already.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Why, man, they did make love to this employment;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>They are not near my conscience; their defeat</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Does by their own insinuation grow:</A><br>
<A NAME=64>'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Between the pass and fell incensed points</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Of mighty opposites.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Why, what a king is this!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--</A><br>
<A NAME=69>He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Thrown out his angle for my proper life,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>To let this canker of our nature come</A><br>
<A NAME=75>In further evil?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>It must be shortly known to him from England</A><br>
<A NAME=77>What is the issue of the business there.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>It will be short: the interim is mine;</A><br>
<A NAME=79>And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'</A><br>
<A NAME=80>But I am very sorry, good Horatio,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>That to Laertes I forgot myself;</A><br>
<A NAME=82>For, by the image of my cause, I see</A><br>
<A NAME=83>The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.</A><br>
<A NAME=84>But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Into a towering passion.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=86>Peace! who comes here?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter OSRIC</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=89>No, my good lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=90>Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to</A><br>
<A NAME=91>know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a</A><br>
<A NAME=92>beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at</A><br>
<A NAME=93>the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>spacious in the possession of dirt.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I</A><br>
<A NAME=96>should impart a thing to you from his majesty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of</A><br>
<A NAME=98>spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>I thank your lordship, it is very hot.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is</A><br>
<A NAME=101>northerly.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my</A><br>
<A NAME=104>complexion.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=105>Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as</A><br>
<A NAME=106>'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his</A><br>
<A NAME=107>majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a</A><br>
<A NAME=108>great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=109>I beseech you, remember--</A><br>
<p><i>HAMLET moves him to put on his hat</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=110>Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe</A><br>
<A NAME=112>me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent</A><br>
<A NAME=113>differences, of very soft society and great showing:</A><br>
<A NAME=114>indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or</A><br>
<A NAME=115>calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the</A><br>
<A NAME=116>continent of what part a gentleman would see.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;</A><br>
<A NAME=118>though, I know, to divide him inventorially would</A><br>
<A NAME=119>dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw</A><br>
<A NAME=120>neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the</A><br>
<A NAME=121>verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of</A><br>
<A NAME=122>great article; and his infusion of such dearth and</A><br>
<A NAME=123>rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his</A><br>
<A NAME=124>semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace</A><br>
<A NAME=125>him, his umbrage, nothing more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=126>Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=127>The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman</A><br>
<A NAME=128>in our more rawer breath?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>Sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=130>Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?</A><br>
<A NAME=131>You will do't, sir, really.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=132>What imports the nomination of this gentleman?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=133>Of Laertes?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=134>His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>Of him, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=136>I know you are not ignorant--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=137>I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>it would not much approve me. Well, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with</A><br>
<A NAME=141>him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to</A><br>
<A NAME=142>know himself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation</A><br>
<A NAME=144>laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=145>What's his weapon?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=146>Rapier and dagger.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech50><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=147>That's two of his weapons: but, well.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech51><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=148>The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary</A><br>
<A NAME=149>horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take</A><br>
<A NAME=150>it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their</A><br>
<A NAME=151>assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the</A><br>
<A NAME=152>carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very</A><br>
<A NAME=153>responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>and of very liberal conceit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=155>What call you the carriages?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=157>The carriages, sir, are the hangers.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=158>The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we</A><br>
<A NAME=159>could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might</A><br>
<A NAME=160>be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses</A><br>
<A NAME=161>against six French swords, their assigns, and three</A><br>
<A NAME=162>liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet</A><br>
<A NAME=163>against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=164>The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes</A><br>
<A NAME=165>between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you</A><br>
<A NAME=166>three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it</A><br>
<A NAME=167>would come to immediate trial, if your lordship</A><br>
<A NAME=168>would vouchsafe the answer.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=169>How if I answer 'no'?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech58><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=170>I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech59><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=171>Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his</A><br>
<A NAME=172>majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let</A><br>
<A NAME=173>the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the</A><br>
<A NAME=174>king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;</A><br>
<A NAME=175>if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=176>Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=177>To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech62><b>OSRIC</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=178>I commend my duty to your lordship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech63><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=179>Yours, yours.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit OSRIC</i></p>
<A NAME=180>He does well to commend it himself; there are no</A><br>
<A NAME=181>tongues else for's turn.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech64><b>HORATIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=182>This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech65><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=183>He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.</A><br>
<A NAME=184>Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I</A><br>
<A NAME=185>know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of</A><br>
<A NAME=186>the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of</A><br>
<A NAME=187>yesty collection, which carries them through and</A><br>
<A NAME=188>through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do</A><br>
<A NAME=189>but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Lord</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech66><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=190>My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young</A><br>
<A NAME=191>Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in</A><br>
<A NAME=192>the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to</A><br>
<A NAME=193>play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech67><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=194>I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's</A><br>
<A NAME=195>pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now</A><br>
<A NAME=196>or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=198>In happy time.</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=199>The queen desires you to use some gentle</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=202>You will lose this wager, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech73><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=203>I do not think so: since he went into France, I</A><br>
<A NAME=204>have been in continual practise: I shall win at the</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=207>Nay, good my lord,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech75><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=208>It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of</A><br>

<A NAME=210>If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech77><b>HAMLET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=213>Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special</A><br>
