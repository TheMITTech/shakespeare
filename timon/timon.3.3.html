<H3>SCENE III. A room in Sempronius' house.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>SEMPRONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove</A><br>
<A NAME=2>all others?</A><br>
<A NAME=3>He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;</A><br>
<A NAME=4>And now Ventidius is wealthy too,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Owe their estates unto him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>My lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for</A><br>
<A NAME=9>They have au denied him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>SEMPRONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>How! have they denied him?</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?</A><br>
<A NAME=12>And does he send to me? Three? hum!</A><br>
<A NAME=13>It shows but little love or judgment in him:</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like</A><br>
<A NAME=15>physicians,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,</A><br>
<A NAME=18>That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>But his occasion might have woo'd me first;</A><br>
<A NAME=20>For, in my conscience, I was the first man</A><br>
<A NAME=21>That e'er received gift from him:</A><br>
<A NAME=22>And does he think so backwardly of me now,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>That I'll requite its last? No:</A><br>
<A NAME=24>So it may prove an argument of laughter</A><br>
<A NAME=25>To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.</A><br>
<A NAME=26>I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;</A><br>
<A NAME=28>I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>And with their faint reply this answer join;</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The</A><br>
<A NAME=32>devil knew not what he did when he made man</A><br>
<A NAME=33>politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot</A><br>
<A NAME=34>think but, in the end, the villainies of man will</A><br>
<A NAME=35>set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to</A><br>
<A NAME=36>appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>like those that under hot ardent zeal would set</A><br>
<A NAME=38>whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his</A><br>
<A NAME=39>politic love.</A><br>
<A NAME=40>This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Many a bounteous year must be employ'd</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Now to guard sure their master.</A><br>
<A NAME=45>And this is all a liberal course allows;</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
