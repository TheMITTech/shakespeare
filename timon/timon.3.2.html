<H3>SCENE II. A public place.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and</A><br>
<A NAME=2>an honourable gentleman.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>First Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>We know him for no less, though we are but strangers</A><br>
<A NAME=4>to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and</A><br>
<A NAME=5>which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's</A><br>
<A NAME=6>happy hours are done and past, and his estate</A><br>
<A NAME=7>shrinks from him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Second Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow</A><br>
<A NAME=11>so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and</A><br>
<A NAME=12>showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>How!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Second Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>I tell you, denied, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!</A><br>
<A NAME=17>there was very little honour showed in't. For my own</A><br>
<A NAME=18>part, I must needs confess, I have received some</A><br>
<A NAME=19>small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels</A><br>
<A NAME=20>and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;</A><br>
<A NAME=21>yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should</A><br>
<A NAME=22>ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter SERVILIUS</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>SERVILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;</A><br>
<A NAME=24>I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--</A><br>
<p><i>To LUCIUS</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:</A><br>
<A NAME=26>commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very</A><br>
<A NAME=27>exquisite friend.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>SERVILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to</A><br>
<A NAME=30>that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank</A><br>
<A NAME=31>him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>SERVILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;</A><br>
<A NAME=33>requesting your lordship to supply his instant use</A><br>
<A NAME=34>with so many talents.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=35>I know his lordship is but merry with me;</A><br>
<A NAME=36>He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>SERVILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.</A><br>
<A NAME=38>If his occasion were not virtuous,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>I should not urge it half so faithfully.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>SERVILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself</A><br>
<A NAME=43>against such a good time, when I might ha' shown</A><br>
<A NAME=44>myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I</A><br>
<A NAME=45>should purchase the day before for a little part,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more</A><br>
<A NAME=48>beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon</A><br>
<A NAME=49>myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would</A><br>
<A NAME=50>not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I</A><br>
<A NAME=52>hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>because I have no power to be kind: and tell him</A><br>
<A NAME=54>this from me, I count it one of my greatest</A><br>
<A NAME=55>afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an</A><br>
<A NAME=56>honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you</A><br>
<A NAME=57>befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>SERVILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>Yes, sir, I shall.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>LUCILIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit SERVILIUS</i></p>
<A NAME=60>True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;</A><br>
<A NAME=61>And he that's once denied will hardly speed.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>First Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>Do you observe this, Hostilius?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>Second Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>Ay, too well.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>First Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the</A><br>
<A NAME=65>same piece</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him</A><br>
<A NAME=67>His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in</A><br>
<A NAME=68>My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>And kept his credit with his purse,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;</A><br>
<A NAME=73>And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man</A><br>
<A NAME=74>When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--</A><br>
<A NAME=75>He does deny him, in respect of his,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>What charitable men afford to beggars.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>Third Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Religion groans at it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>First Stranger</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>For mine own part,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>I never tasted Timon in my life,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Nor came any of his bounties over me,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue</A><br>
<A NAME=83>And honourable carriage,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Had his necessity made use of me,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>I would have put my wealth into donation,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>And the best half should have return'd to him,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Men must learn now with pity to dispense;</A><br>
<A NAME=89>For policy sits above conscience.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
