<H3>SCENE II. Athens. A room in Timon's house.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>First Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Hear you, master steward, where's our master?</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>FLAVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>I am as poor as you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>First Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>Such a house broke!</A><br>
<A NAME=7>So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not</A><br>
<A NAME=8>One friend to take his fortune by the arm,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>And go along with him!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Second Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>As we do turn our backs</A><br>
<A NAME=11>From our companion thrown into his grave,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>So his familiars to his buried fortunes</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>A dedicated beggar to the air,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter other Servants</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>FLAVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>All broken implements of a ruin'd house.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Third Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;</A><br>
<A NAME=20>That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Hearing the surges threat: we must all part</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Into this sea of air.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>FLAVIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Good fellows all,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.</A><br>
<p><i>Servants embrace, and part several ways</i></p>
<A NAME=33>O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Since riches point to misery and contempt?</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live</A><br>
<A NAME=37>But in a dream of friendship?</A><br>
<A NAME=38>To have his pomp and all what state compounds</A><br>
<A NAME=39>But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?</A><br>
<A NAME=44>For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.</A><br>
<A NAME=45>My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!</A><br>
<A NAME=48>He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Supply his life, or that which can command it.</A><br>
<A NAME=51>I'll follow and inquire him out:</A><br>
<A NAME=52>I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
