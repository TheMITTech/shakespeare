<H3>SCENE V. The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.</h3>


<A NAME=speech1><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Second Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>Most true; the law shall bruise him.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>Now, captain?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>I am an humble suitor to your virtues;</A><br>
<A NAME=8>For pity is the virtue of the law,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>And none but tyrants use it cruelly.</A><br>
<A NAME=10>It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth</A><br>
<A NAME=13>To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.</A><br>
<A NAME=14>He is a man, setting his fate aside,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Of comely virtues:</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--</A><br>
<A NAME=17>An honour in him which buys out his fault--</A><br>
<A NAME=18>But with a noble fury and fair spirit,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>He did oppose his foe:</A><br>
<A NAME=21>And with such sober and unnoted passion</A><br>
<A NAME=22>He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>As if he had but proved an argument.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>You undergo too strict a paradox,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd</A><br>
<A NAME=27>To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Upon the head of valour; which indeed</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Is valour misbegot and came into the world</A><br>
<A NAME=30>When sects and factions were newly born:</A><br>
<A NAME=31>He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer</A><br>
<A NAME=32>The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs</A><br>
<A NAME=33>His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>carelessly,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>To bring it into danger.</A><br>
<A NAME=37>If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>My lord,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>       You cannot make gross sins look clear:</A><br>
<A NAME=41>To revenge is no valour, but to bear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>If I speak like a captain.</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>And let the foes quietly cut their throats,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Without repugnancy? If there be</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Such valour in the bearing, what make we</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Abroad? why then, women are more valiant</A><br>
<A NAME=50>That stay at home, if bearing carry it,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>As you are great, be pitifully good:</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?</A><br>
<A NAME=56>To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;</A><br>
<A NAME=57>But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.</A><br>
<A NAME=58>To be in anger is impiety;</A><br>
<A NAME=59>But who is man that is not angry?</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Weigh but the crime with this.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Second Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>You breathe in vain.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>In vain! his service done</A><br>
<A NAME=63>At Lacedaemon and Byzantium</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Were a sufficient briber for his life.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>What's that?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>I say, my lords, he has done fair service,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>And slain in fight many of your enemies:</A><br>
<A NAME=68>How full of valour did he bear himself</A><br>
<A NAME=69>In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Second Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>He has made too much plenty with 'em;</A><br>
<A NAME=71>He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:</A><br>
<A NAME=73>If there were no foes, that were enough</A><br>
<A NAME=74>To overcome him: in that beastly fury</A><br>
<A NAME=75>He has been known to commit outrages,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>His days are foul and his drink dangerous.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>He dies.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>Hard fate! he might have died in war.</A><br>
<A NAME=80>My lords, if not for any parts in him--</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Though his right arm might purchase his own time</A><br>
<A NAME=82>And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:</A><br>
<A NAME=84>And, for I know your reverend ages love</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Security, I'll pawn my victories, all</A><br>
<A NAME=86>My honours to you, upon his good returns.</A><br>
<A NAME=87>If by this crime he owes the law his life,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore</A><br>
<A NAME=89>For law is strict, and war is nothing more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=90>We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>He forfeits his own blood that spills another.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>I do beseech you, know me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>Second Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>How!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Call me to your remembrances.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>Third Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>What!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>I cannot think but your age has forgot me;</A><br>
<A NAME=99>It could not else be, I should prove so base,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>To sue, and be denied such common grace:</A><br>
<A NAME=101>My wounds ache at you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>Do you dare our anger?</A><br>
<A NAME=103>'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>We banish thee for ever.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=105>Banish me!</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Banish your dotage; banish usury,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>That makes the senate ugly.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>First Senator</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell</A><br>
<A NAME=110>our spirit,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>He shall be executed presently.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Senators</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>ALCIBIADES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=112>Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Only in bone, that none may look on you!</A><br>
<A NAME=114>I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>While they have told their money and let out</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Their coin upon large interest, I myself</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?</A><br>
<A NAME=118>Is this the balsam that the usuring senate</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!</A><br>
<A NAME=120>It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=121>It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up</A><br>
<A NAME=123>My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.</A><br>
<A NAME=124>'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
