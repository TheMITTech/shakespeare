<H3>SCENE I. KING HENRY IV's camp near Shrewsbury.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of  LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and FALSTAFF</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>How bloodily the sun begins to peer</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale</A><br>
<A NAME=3>At his distemperature.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>The southern wind</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>And by his hollow whistling in the leaves</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Then with the losers let it sympathize,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>For nothing can seem foul to those that win.</A><br>
<p><i>The trumpet sounds</i></p>
<p><i>Enter WORCESTER and VERNON</i></p>
<A NAME=10>How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well</A><br>
<A NAME=11>That you and I should meet upon such terms</A><br>
<A NAME=12>As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>And made us doff our easy robes of peace,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:</A><br>
<A NAME=15>This is not well, my lord, this is not well.</A><br>
<A NAME=16>What say you to it? will you again unknit</A><br>
<A NAME=17>This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?</A><br>
<A NAME=18>And move in that obedient orb again</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Where you did give a fair and natural light,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>And be no more an exhaled meteor,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>A prodigy of fear and a portent</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Of broached mischief to the unborn times?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>EARL OF WORCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>Hear me, my liege:</A><br>
<A NAME=24>For mine own part, I could be well content</A><br>
<A NAME=25>To entertain the lag-end of my life</A><br>
<A NAME=26>With quiet hours; for I do protest,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>I have not sought the day of this dislike.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>You have not sought it! how comes it, then?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Peace, chewet, peace!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>EARL OF WORCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>It pleased your majesty to turn your looks</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Of favour from myself and all our house;</A><br>
<A NAME=33>And yet I must remember you, my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>We were the first and dearest of your friends.</A><br>
<A NAME=35>For you my staff of office did I break</A><br>
<A NAME=36>In Richard's time; and posted day and night</A><br>
<A NAME=37>to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>When yet you were in place and in account</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.</A><br>
<A NAME=40>It was myself, my brother and his son,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>That brought you home and boldly did outdare</A><br>
<A NAME=42>The dangers of the time. You swore to us,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:</A><br>
<A NAME=47>To this we swore our aid. But in short space</A><br>
<A NAME=48>It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;</A><br>
<A NAME=49>And such a flood of greatness fell on you,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>What with our help, what with the absent king,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>What with the injuries of a wanton time,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>The seeming sufferances that you had borne,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>And the contrarious winds that held the king</A><br>
<A NAME=54>So long in his unlucky Irish wars</A><br>
<A NAME=55>That all in England did repute him dead:</A><br>
<A NAME=56>And from this swarm of fair advantages</A><br>
<A NAME=57>You took occasion to be quickly woo'd</A><br>
<A NAME=58>To gripe the general sway into your hand;</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;</A><br>
<A NAME=60>And being fed by us you used us so</A><br>
<A NAME=61>As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk</A><br>
<A NAME=64>That even our love durst not come near your sight</A><br>
<A NAME=65>For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing</A><br>
<A NAME=66>We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Out of sight and raise this present head;</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Whereby we stand opposed by such means</A><br>
<A NAME=69>As you yourself have forged against yourself</A><br>
<A NAME=70>By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>And violation of all faith and troth</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>These things indeed you have articulate,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>To face the garment of rebellion</A><br>
<A NAME=76>With some fine colour that may please the eye</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Which gape and rub the elbow at the news</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Of hurlyburly innovation:</A><br>
<A NAME=80>And never yet did insurrection want</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Such water-colours to impaint his cause;</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Nor moody beggars, starving for a time</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Of pellmell havoc and confusion.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>In both your armies there is many a soul</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world</A><br>
<A NAME=88>In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>This present enterprise set off his head,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>I do not think a braver gentleman,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>More active-valiant or more valiant-young,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>More daring or more bold, is now alive</A><br>
<A NAME=93>To grace this latter age with noble deeds.</A><br>
<A NAME=94>For my part, I may speak it to my shame,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>I have a truant been to chivalry;</A><br>
<A NAME=96>And so I hear he doth account me too;</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Yet this before my father's majesty--</A><br>
<A NAME=98>I am content that he shall take the odds</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Of his great name and estimation,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>And will, to save the blood on either side,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Try fortune with him in a single fight.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Albeit considerations infinite</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>We love our people well; even those we love</A><br>
<A NAME=106>That are misled upon your cousin's part;</A><br>
<A NAME=107>And, will they take the offer of our grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Both he and they and you, every man</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:</A><br>
<A NAME=110>So tell your cousin, and bring me word</A><br>
<A NAME=111>What he will do: but if he will not yield,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Rebuke and dread correction wait on us</A><br>
<A NAME=113>And they shall do their office. So, be gone;</A><br>
<A NAME=114>We will not now be troubled with reply:</A><br>
<A NAME=115>We offer fair; take it advisedly.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>It will not be accepted, on my life:</A><br>
<A NAME=117>The Douglas and the Hotspur both together</A><br>
<A NAME=118>Are confident against the world in arms.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>KING HENRY IV</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;</A><br>
<A NAME=120>For, on their answer, will we set on them:</A><br>
<A NAME=121>And God befriend us, as our cause is just!</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=122>Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride</A><br>
<A NAME=123>me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=124>Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Say thy prayers, and farewell.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=126>I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>PRINCE HENRY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=127>Why, thou owest God a death.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit PRINCE HENRY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before</A><br>
<A NAME=129>his day. What need I be so forward with him that</A><br>
<A NAME=130>calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks</A><br>
<A NAME=131>me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I</A><br>
<A NAME=132>come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or</A><br>
<A NAME=133>an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is</A><br>
<A NAME=135>honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what</A><br>
<A NAME=136>is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?</A><br>
<A NAME=137>he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>to the dead. But will it not live with the living?</A><br>
<A NAME=140>no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore</A><br>
<A NAME=141>I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so</A><br>
<A NAME=142>ends my catechism.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
