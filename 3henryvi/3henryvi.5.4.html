<h3>SCENE IV. Plains near Teaksbury.</h3>

<p></blockquote>
<blockquote><i>March. Enter QUEEN MARGARET, PRINCE EDWARD, SOMERSET, OXFORD, and soldiers</i></blockquote>

<b>QUEEN MARGARET</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.</A><br>
<A NAME=3>What though the mast be now blown overboard,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad</A><br>
<A NAME=8>With tearful eyes add water to the sea</A><br>
<A NAME=9>And give more strength to that which hath too much,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Which industry and courage might have saved?</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?</A><br>
<A NAME=14>And Montague our topmost; what of him?</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Why, is not Oxford here another anchor</A><br>
<A NAME=17>And Somerset another goodly mast?</A><br>
<A NAME=18>The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?</A><br>
<A NAME=19>And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I</A><br>
<A NAME=20>For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?</A><br>
<A NAME=21>We will not from the helm to sit and weep,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.</A><br>
<A NAME=24>As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.</A><br>
<A NAME=25>And what is Edward but ruthless sea?</A><br>
<A NAME=26>What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?</A><br>
<A NAME=27>And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?</A><br>
<A NAME=28>All these the enemies to our poor bark.</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.</A><br>
<A NAME=33>This speak I, lords, to let you understand,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>If case some one of you would fly from us,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers</A><br>
<A NAME=36>More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided</A><br>
<A NAME=38>'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>PRINCE EDWARD</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Infuse his breast with magnanimity</A><br>
<A NAME=42>And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.</A><br>
<A NAME=43>I speak not this as doubting any here</A><br>
<A NAME=44>For did I but suspect a fearful man</A><br>
<A NAME=45>He should have leave to go away betimes,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Lest in our need he might infect another</A><br>
<A NAME=47>And make him of like spirit to himself.</A><br>
<A NAME=48>If any such be here--as God forbid!</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Let him depart before we need his help.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>OXFORD</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=50>Women and children of so high a courage,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame</A><br>
<A NAME=52>O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live</A><br>
<A NAME=54>To bear his image and renew his glories!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>SOMERSET</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>And he that will not fight for such a hope.</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>QUEEN MARGARET</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>PRINCE EDWARD</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote><i>Enter a Messenger</i></blockquote>

<b>Messenger</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>OXFORD</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>I thought no less: it is his policy</A><br>
<A NAME=63>To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>SOMERSET</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>But he's deceived; we are in readiness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>QUEEN MARGARET</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>OXFORD</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<i>Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and soldiers</i>
</blockquote>

<b>KING EDWARD IV</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.</A><br>
<A NAME=70>I need not add more fuel to your fire,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<b>QUEEN MARGARET</b>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say</A><br>
<A NAME=74>My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.</A><br>
<A NAME=76>Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;</A><br>
<A NAME=80>And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.</A><br>
<A NAME=81>You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Be valiant and give signal to the fight.</A><br>
</blockquote>
