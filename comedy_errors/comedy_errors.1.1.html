<h3>SCENE I. A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.</H3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other Attendants</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall</A><br>
<A NAME=2>And by the doom of death end woes and all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;</A><br>
<A NAME=4>I am not partial to infringe our laws:</A><br>
<A NAME=5>The enmity and discord which of late</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke</A><br>
<A NAME=7>To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.</A><br>
<A NAME=11>For, since the mortal and intestine jars</A><br>
<A NAME=12>'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>It hath in solemn synods been decreed</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>If any born at Ephesus be seen</A><br>
<A NAME=17>At any Syracusian marts and fairs;</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Again: if any Syracusian born</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Unless a thousand marks be levied,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>To quit the penalty and to ransom him.</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=26>Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>My woes end likewise with the evening sun.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Why thou departed'st from thy native home</A><br>
<A NAME=30>And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>A heavier task could not have been imposed</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Yet, that the world may witness that my end</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.</A><br>
<A NAME=36>In Syracusa was I born, and wed</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Unto a woman, happy but for me,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And by me, had not our hap been bad.</A><br>
<A NAME=39>With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased</A><br>
<A NAME=40>By prosperous voyages I often made</A><br>
<A NAME=41>To Epidamnum; till my factor's death</A><br>
<A NAME=42>And the great care of goods at random left</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:</A><br>
<A NAME=44>From whom my absence was not six months old</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Before herself, almost at fainting under</A><br>
<A NAME=46>The pleasing punishment that women bear,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Had made provision for her following me</A><br>
<A NAME=48>And soon and safe arrived where I was.</A><br>
<A NAME=49>There had she not been long, but she became</A><br>
<A NAME=50>A joyful mother of two goodly sons;</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And, which was strange, the one so like the other,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>As could not be distinguish'd but by names.</A><br>
<A NAME=53>That very hour, and in the self-same inn,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>A meaner woman was delivered</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--</A><br>
<A NAME=57>I bought and brought up to attend my sons.</A><br>
<A NAME=58>My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Made daily motions for our home return:</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>We came aboard.</A><br>
<A NAME=62>A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Before the always wind-obeying deep</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Gave any tragic instance of our harm:</A><br>
<A NAME=65>But longer did we not retain much hope;</A><br>
<A NAME=66>For what obscured light the heavens did grant</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Did but convey unto our fearful minds</A><br>
<A NAME=68>A doubtful warrant of immediate death;</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Which though myself would gladly have embraced,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Weeping before for what she saw must come,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Forced me to seek delays for them and me.</A><br>
<A NAME=75>And this it was, for other means was none:</A><br>
<A NAME=76>The sailors sought for safety by our boat,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:</A><br>
<A NAME=78>My wife, more careful for the latter-born,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Such as seafaring men provide for storms;</A><br>
<A NAME=81>To him one of the other twins was bound,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:</A><br>
<A NAME=83>The children thus disposed, my wife and I,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;</A><br>
<A NAME=86>And floating straight, obedient to the stream,</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.</A><br>
<A NAME=88>At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Dispersed those vapours that offended us;</A><br>
<A NAME=90>And by the benefit of his wished light,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Two ships from far making amain to us,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:</A><br>
<A NAME=94>But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Gather the sequel by that went before.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;</A><br>
<A NAME=97>For we may pity, though not pardon thee.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>O, had the gods done so, I had not now</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Worthily term'd them merciless to us!</A><br>
<A NAME=100>For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>We were encounterd by a mighty rock;</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Which being violently borne upon,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>So that, in this unjust divorce of us,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Fortune had left to both of us alike</A><br>
<A NAME=106>What to delight in, what to sorrow for.</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened</A><br>
<A NAME=108>With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Was carried with more speed before the wind;</A><br>
<A NAME=110>And in our sight they three were taken up</A><br>
<A NAME=111>By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.</A><br>
<A NAME=112>At length, another ship had seized on us;</A><br>
<A NAME=113>And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,</A><br>
<A NAME=114>Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;</A><br>
<A NAME=115>And would have reft the fishers of their prey,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Had not their bark been very slow of sail;</A><br>
<A NAME=117>And therefore homeward did they bend their course.</A><br>
<A NAME=118>Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;</A><br>
<A NAME=119>That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=121>And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Do me the favour to dilate at full</A><br>
<A NAME=123>What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=124>My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,</A><br>
<A NAME=125>At eighteen years became inquisitive</A><br>
<A NAME=126>After his brother: and importuned me</A><br>
<A NAME=127>That his attendant--so his case was like,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--</A><br>
<A NAME=129>Might bear him company in the quest of him:</A><br>
<A NAME=130>Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,</A><br>
<A NAME=131>I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought</A><br>
<A NAME=136>Or that or any place that harbours men.</A><br>
<A NAME=137>But here must end the story of my life;</A><br>
<A NAME=138>And happy were I in my timely death,</A><br>
<A NAME=139>Could all my travels warrant me they live.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd</A><br>
<A NAME=141>To bear the extremity of dire mishap!</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,</A><br>
<A NAME=143>Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Which princes, would they, may not disannul,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>My soul would sue as advocate for thee.</A><br>
<A NAME=146>But, though thou art adjudged to the death</A><br>
<A NAME=147>And passed sentence may not be recall'd</A><br>
<A NAME=148>But to our honour's great disparagement,</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Yet I will favour thee in what I can.</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day</A><br>
<A NAME=151>To seek thy life by beneficial help:</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.</A><br>
<A NAME=155>Gaoler, take him to thy custody.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>Gaoler</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>I will, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>AEGEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=157>Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,</A><br>
<A NAME=158>But to procrastinate his lifeless end.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
