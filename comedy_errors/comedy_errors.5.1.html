</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>ANGELO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Of very reverend reputation, sir,</A><br>

<A NAME=13>Signior Antipholus, I wonder much</A><br>
<A NAME=14>That you would put me to this shame and trouble;</A><br>
<A NAME=15>And, not without some scandal to yourself,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>With circumstance and oaths so to deny</A><br>
<A NAME=17>This chain which now you wear so openly:</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>You have done wrong to this my honest friend,</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Who, but for staying on our controversy,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Second Merchant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>I am sorry now that I did draw on him.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech18><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>How long hath this possession held the man?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=48>This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>And much different from the man he was;</A><br>
<A NAME=50>But till this afternoon his passion</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?</A><br>
<A NAME=55>A sin prevailing much in youthful men,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Which of these sorrows is he subject to?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>To none of these, except it be the last;</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>You should for that have reprehended him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Why, so I did.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>                  Ay, but not rough enough.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>As roughly as my modesty would let me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Haply, in private.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>And in assemblies too.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>Ay, but not enough.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>It was the copy of our conference:</A><br>
<A NAME=68>In bed he slept not for my urging it;</A><br>
<A NAME=69>At board he fed not for my urging it;</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Alone, it was the subject of my theme;</A><br>
<A NAME=71>In company I often glanced it;</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=73>And thereof came it that the man was mad.</A><br>
<A NAME=74>The venom clamours of a jealous woman</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.</A><br>
<A NAME=76>It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>And therefore comes it that his head is light.</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Unquiet meals make ill digestions;</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And what's a fever but a fit of madness?</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue</A><br>
<A NAME=84>But moody and dull melancholy,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>And at her heels a huge infectious troop</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?</A><br>
<A NAME=88>In food, in sport and life-preserving rest</A><br>
<A NAME=89>To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:</A><br>
<A NAME=90>The consequence is then thy jealous fits</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>LUCIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>She never reprehended him but mildly,</A><br>
<A NAME=93>When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.</A><br>
<A NAME=94>Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>She did betray me to my own reproof.</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Good people enter and lay hold on him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>No, not a creature enters in my house.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>Then let your servants bring my husband forth.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>And it shall privilege him from your hands</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Till I have brought him to his wits again,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Or lose my labour in assaying it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>I will attend my husband, be his nurse,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Diet his sickness, for it is my office,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>And will have no attorney but myself;</A><br>
<A NAME=106>And therefore let me have him home with me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>Be patient; for I will not let him stir</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Till I have used the approved means I have,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>To make of him a formal man again:</A><br>
<A NAME=111>It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>A charitable duty of my order.</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Therefore depart and leave him here with me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>I will not hence and leave my husband here:</A><br>
<A NAME=115>And ill it doth beseem your holiness</A><br>
<A NAME=116>To separate the husband and the wife.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>AEMELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>LUCIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>Complain unto the duke of this indignity.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet</A><br>
<A NAME=120>And never rise until my tears and prayers</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Have won his grace to come in person hither</A><br>
<A NAME=122>And take perforce my husband from the abbess.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>Second Merchant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=123>By this, I think, the dial points at five:</A><br>
<A NAME=124>Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Comes this way to the melancholy vale,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>The place of death and sorry execution,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Behind the ditches of the abbey here.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>ANGELO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>Upon what cause?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>Second Merchant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,</A><br>
<A NAME=130>Who put unluckily into this bay</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Against the laws and statutes of this town,</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>ANGELO</b></a>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<blockquote>

<A NAME=137>He shall not die; so much we tender him.</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>DUKE SOLINUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:</A><br>
<A NAME=140>It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech50><b>ADRIANA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Whom I made lord of me and all I had,</A><br>
<A NAME=143>At your important letters,--this ill day</A><br>
<A NAME=144>A most outrageous fit of madness took him;</A><br>
<A NAME=145>That desperately he hurried through the street,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>With him his bondman, all as mad as he--</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Doing displeasure to the citizens</A><br>
<A NAME=148>By rushing in their houses, bearing thence</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Once did I get him bound and sent him home,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,</A><br>
<A NAME=152>That here and there his fury had committed.</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>He broke from those that had the guard of him;</A><br>
<A NAME=155>And with his mad attendant and himself,</A><br>
<A NAME=156>Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>Met us again and madly bent on us,</A><br>
<A NAME=158>Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>We came again to bind them. Then they fled</A><br>
<A NAME=160>Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:</A><br>
<A NAME=161>And here the abbess shuts the gates on us</A><br>
<A NAME=162>And will not suffer us to fetch him out,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command</A><br>
<A NAME=165>Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.</A><br>

<A NAME=169>To do him all the grace and good I could.</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate</A><br>
