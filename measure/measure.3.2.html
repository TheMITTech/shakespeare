<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will</A><br>
<A NAME=2>needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we</A><br>
<A NAME=3>shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>O heavens! what stuff is here</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the</A><br>
<A NAME=6>merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by</A><br>
<A NAME=7>order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and</A><br>
<A NAME=8>furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that</A><br>
<A NAME=9>craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>And you, good brother father. What offence hath</A><br>
<A NAME=12>this man made you, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we</A><br>
<A NAME=14>take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found</A><br>
<A NAME=15>upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have</A><br>
<A NAME=16>sent to the deputy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!</A><br>
<A NAME=18>The evil that thou causest to be done,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>That is thy means to live. Do thou but think</A><br>
<A NAME=20>What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back</A><br>
<A NAME=21>From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>From their abominable and beastly touches</A><br>
<A NAME=23>I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Canst thou believe thy living is a life,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=26>Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>sir, I would prove--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Correction and instruction must both work</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Ere this rude beast will profit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him</A><br>
<A NAME=33>warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if</A><br>
<A NAME=34>he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were</A><br>
<A NAME=35>as good go a mile on his errand.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>That we were all, as some would seem to be,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a</A><br>
<A NAME=40>friend of mine.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter LUCIO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there</A><br>
<A NAME=43>none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be</A><br>
<A NAME=44>had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and</A><br>
<A NAME=45>extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What</A><br>
<A NAME=46>sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't</A><br>
<A NAME=47>not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest</A><br>
<A NAME=48>thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is</A><br>
<A NAME=49>the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The</A><br>
<A NAME=50>trick of it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>Still thus, and thus; still worse!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she</A><br>
<A NAME=53>still, ha?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she</A><br>
<A NAME=55>is herself in the tub.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be</A><br>
<A NAME=57>so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:</A><br>
<A NAME=58>an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going</A><br>
<A NAME=59>to prison, Pompey?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>Yes, faith, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I</A><br>
<A NAME=62>sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>For being a bawd, for being a bawd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the</A><br>
<A NAME=65>due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he</A><br>
<A NAME=66>doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you</A><br>
<A NAME=69>will keep the house.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.</A><br>
<A NAME=72>I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If</A><br>
<A NAME=73>you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the</A><br>
<A NAME=74>more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>And you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Come your ways, sir; come.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>POMPEY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>You will not bail me, then, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?</A><br>
<A NAME=80>what news?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>ELBOW</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Come your ways, sir; come.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Go to kennel, Pompey; go.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers</i></p>
<A NAME=83>What news, friar, of the duke?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>I know none. Can you tell me of any?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other</A><br>
<A NAME=86>some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from</A><br>
<A NAME=89>the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born</A><br>
<A NAME=90>to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he</A><br>
<A NAME=91>puts transgression to 't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>He does well in 't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in</A><br>
<A NAME=94>him: something too crabbed that way, friar.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;</A><br>
<A NAME=97>it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp</A><br>
<A NAME=98>it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put</A><br>
<A NAME=99>down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and</A><br>
<A NAME=100>woman after this downright way of creation: is it</A><br>
<A NAME=101>true, think you?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>How should he be made, then?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he</A><br>
<A NAME=104>was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is</A><br>
<A NAME=105>certain that when he makes water his urine is</A><br>
<A NAME=106>congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a</A><br>
<A NAME=107>motion generative; that's infallible.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=109>Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the</A><br>
<A NAME=110>rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a</A><br>
<A NAME=111>man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a</A><br>
<A NAME=113>hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing</A><br>
<A NAME=114>a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he</A><br>
<A NAME=115>knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>I never heard the absent duke much detected for</A><br>
<A NAME=117>women; he was not inclined that way.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>O, sir, you are deceived.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>'Tis not possible.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=120>Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and</A><br>
<A NAME=121>his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the</A><br>
<A NAME=122>duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;</A><br>
<A NAME=123>that let me inform you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=124>You do him wrong, surely.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=125>Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the</A><br>
<A NAME=126>duke: and I believe I know the cause of his</A><br>
<A NAME=127>withdrawing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech50><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>What, I prithee, might be the cause?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech51><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the</A><br>
<A NAME=130>teeth and the lips: but this I can let you</A><br>
<A NAME=131>understand, the greater file of the subject held the</A><br>
<A NAME=132>duke to be wise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=133>Wise! why, no question but he was.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=134>A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:</A><br>
<A NAME=136>the very stream of his life and the business he hath</A><br>
<A NAME=137>helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better</A><br>
<A NAME=138>proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own</A><br>
<A NAME=139>bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the</A><br>
<A NAME=140>envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your</A><br>
<A NAME=142>knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>Sir, I know him, and I love him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with</A><br>
<A NAME=145>dearer love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=146>Come, sir, I know what I know.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech58><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=147>I can hardly believe that, since you know not what</A><br>
<A NAME=148>you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our</A><br>
<A NAME=149>prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your</A><br>
<A NAME=150>answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call</A><br>
<A NAME=152>upon you; and, I pray you, your name?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech59><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=153>Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=154>He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to</A><br>
<A NAME=155>report you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>I fear you not.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech62><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=157>O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you</A><br>
<A NAME=158>imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I</A><br>
<A NAME=159>can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech63><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=160>I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if</A><br>
<A NAME=162>Claudio die to-morrow or no?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech64><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=163>Why should he die, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech65><b>LUCIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=164>Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would</A><br>
<A NAME=165>the duke we talk of were returned again: the</A><br>
<A NAME=166>ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with</A><br>
<A NAME=167>continency; sparrows must not build in his</A><br>
<A NAME=168>house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke</A><br>
<A NAME=169>yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would</A><br>
<A NAME=170>never bring them to light: would he were returned!</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.</A><br>
<A NAME=172>Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The</A><br>
<A NAME=173>duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on</A><br>
<A NAME=174>Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=175>he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown</A><br>
<A NAME=176>bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech66><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=177>No might nor greatness in mortality</A><br>
<A NAME=178>Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny</A><br>
<A NAME=179>The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong</A><br>
<A NAME=180>Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?</A><br>
<A NAME=181>But who comes here?</A><br>
<p><i>Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech67><b>ESCALUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=182>Go; away with her to prison!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech68><b>MISTRESS OVERDONE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=183>Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted</A><br>
<A NAME=184>a merciful man; good my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech69><b>ESCALUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=185>Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in</A><br>
<A NAME=186>the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play</A><br>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech71><b>MISTRESS OVERDONE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=190>My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.</A><br>

<A NAME=194>I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech72><b>ESCALUS</b></a>
<blockquote>

<A NAME=speech77><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=208>Not of this country, though my chance is now</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=212>What news abroad i' the world?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech79><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=213>None, but that there is so great a fever on</A><br>
<A NAME=214>goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:</A><br>
<A NAME=215>novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous</A><br>
<A NAME=216>to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous</A><br>
<A NAME=217>to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce</A><br>
<A NAME=218>truth enough alive to make societies secure; but</A><br>
<A NAME=219>security enough to make fellowships accurst: much</A><br>
<A NAME=220>upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This</A><br>
<A NAME=221>news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I</A><br>
<A NAME=222>pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech80><b>ESCALUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=223>One that, above all other strifes, contended</A><br>
<A NAME=224>especially to know himself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech81><b>DUKE VINCENTIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=225>What pleasure was he given to?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech82><b>ESCALUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=226>Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at</A><br>
<A NAME=227>any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a</A><br>
<A NAME=228>gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to</A><br>
<A NAME=229>his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;</A><br>
<A NAME=230>and let me desire to know how you find Claudio</A><br>

<A NAME=233>He professes to have received no sinister measure</A><br>
<A NAME=234>from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself</A><br>
<A NAME=235>to the determination of justice: yet had he framed</A><br>
<A NAME=236>to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many</A><br>
<A NAME=237>deceiving promises of life; which I by my good</A><br>
<A NAME=238>leisure have discredited to him, and now is he</A><br>
<A NAME=239>resolved to die.</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=240>You have paid the heavens your function, and the</A><br>
<A NAME=241>prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have</A><br>
<A NAME=242>laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest</A><br>
<A NAME=243>shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I</A><br>
<A NAME=244>found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him</A><br>
<A NAME=245>he is indeed Justice.</A><br>

<p><i>Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost</i></p>
<A NAME=251>He who the sword of heaven will bear</A><br>

<A NAME=254>Grace to stand, and virtue go;</A><br>
<A NAME=255>More nor less to others paying</A><br>

<A NAME=263>How may likeness made in crimes,</A><br>
