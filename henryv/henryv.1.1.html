<H3>SCENE I. London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign</A><br>
<A NAME=3>Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>But that the scambling and unquiet time</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Did push it out of farther question.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>It must be thought on. If it pass against us,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>We lose the better half of our possession:</A><br>
<A NAME=9>For all the temporal lands which men devout</A><br>
<A NAME=10>By testament have given to the church</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Would they strip from us; being valued thus:</A><br>
<A NAME=12>As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;</A><br>
<A NAME=15>And, to relief of lazars and weak age,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.</A><br>
<A NAME=17>A hundred almshouses right well supplied;</A><br>
<A NAME=18>And to the coffers of the king beside,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>This would drink deep.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>'Twould drink the cup and all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=22>But what prevention?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>The king is full of grace and fair regard.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>And a true lover of the holy church.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>The courses of his youth promised it not.</A><br>
<A NAME=26>The breath no sooner left his father's body,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>But that his wildness, mortified in him,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment</A><br>
<A NAME=29>Consideration, like an angel, came</A><br>
<A NAME=30>And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Leaving his body as a paradise,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>To envelop and contain celestial spirits.</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Never was such a sudden scholar made;</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Never came reformation in a flood,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>With such a heady currance, scouring faults</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness</A><br>
<A NAME=37>So soon did lose his seat and all at once</A><br>
<A NAME=38>As in this king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>                  We are blessed in the change.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Hear him but reason in divinity,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>And all-admiring with an inward wish</A><br>
<A NAME=42>You would desire the king were made a prelate:</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>You would say it hath been all in all his study:</A><br>
<A NAME=45>List his discourse of war, and you shall hear</A><br>
<A NAME=46>A fearful battle render'd you in music:</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Turn him to any cause of policy,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;</A><br>
<A NAME=53>So that the art and practic part of life</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Must be the mistress to this theoric:</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Since his addiction was to courses vain,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,</A><br>
<A NAME=58>His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>And never noted in him any study,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Any retirement, any sequestration</A><br>
<A NAME=61>From open haunts and popularity.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>The strawberry grows underneath the nettle</A><br>
<A NAME=63>And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:</A><br>
<A NAME=65>And so the prince obscured his contemplation</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>It must be so; for miracles are ceased;</A><br>
<A NAME=70>And therefore we must needs admit the means</A><br>
<A NAME=71>How things are perfected.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=72>But, my good lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>How now for mitigation of this bill</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Incline to it, or no?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>He seems indifferent,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Or rather swaying more upon our part</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;</A><br>
<A NAME=79>For I have made an offer to his majesty,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Upon our spiritual convocation</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And in regard of causes now in hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Which I have open'd to his grace at large,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>As touching France, to give a greater sum</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Than ever at one time the clergy yet</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Did to his predecessors part withal.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=86>How did this offer seem received, my lord?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>With good acceptance of his majesty;</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Save that there was not time enough to hear,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>As I perceived his grace would fain have done,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>The severals and unhidden passages</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms</A><br>
<A NAME=92>And generally to the crown and seat of France</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=94>What was the impediment that broke this off?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>The French ambassador upon that instant</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come</A><br>
<A NAME=97>To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>It is.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>CANTERBURY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>Then go we in, to know his embassy;</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Which I could with a ready guess declare,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>ELY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
