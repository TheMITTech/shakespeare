<A NAME=speech1><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly</A><br>
<A NAME=2>against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of</A><br>
<A NAME=3>knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your</A><br>
<A NAME=4>conscience, now, is it not?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the</A><br>
<A NAME=6>cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done</A><br>
<A NAME=7>this slaughter: besides, they have burned and</A><br>
<A NAME=8>carried away all that was in the king's tent;</A><br>
<A NAME=9>wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every</A><br>
<A NAME=10>soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a</A><br>
<A NAME=11>gallant king!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=12>Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What</A><br>
<A NAME=13>call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>Alexander the Great.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the</A><br>
<A NAME=16>great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the</A><br>
<A NAME=17>magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase</A><br>
<A NAME=18>is a little variations.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his</A><br>
<A NAME=20>father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I</A><br>
<A NAME=22>tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the</A><br>
<A NAME=23>'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons</A><br>
<A NAME=24>between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>look you, is both alike. There is a river in</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is</A><br>
<A NAME=28>out of my prains what is the name of the other</A><br>
<A NAME=29>river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is</A><br>
<A NAME=30>to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you</A><br>
<A NAME=31>mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life</A><br>
<A NAME=32>is come after it indifferent well; for there is</A><br>
<A NAME=33>figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and</A><br>
<A NAME=34>you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his</A><br>
<A NAME=35>wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his</A><br>
<A NAME=36>displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a</A><br>
<A NAME=37>little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and</A><br>
<A NAME=38>his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>Our king is not like him in that: he never killed</A><br>
<A NAME=40>any of his friends.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out</A><br>
<A NAME=42>of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak</A><br>
<A NAME=43>but in the figures and comparisons of it: as</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his</A><br>
<A NAME=45>ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in</A><br>
<A NAME=46>his right wits and his good judgments, turned away</A><br>
<A NAME=47>the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he</A><br>
<A NAME=48>was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and</A><br>
<A NAME=49>mocks; I have forgot his name.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=50>Sir John Falstaff.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Here comes his majesty.</A><br>
<p><i>Alarum. Enter KING HENRY, and forces; WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, EXETER, and others</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=53>I was not angry since I came to France</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:</A><br>
<A NAME=56>If they will fight with us, bid them come down,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Or void the field; they do offend our sight:</A><br>
<A NAME=58>If they'll do neither, we will come to them,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>And make them skirr away, as swift as stones</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And not a man of them that we shall take</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter MONTJOY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>EXETER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=65>His eyes are humbler than they used to be.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not</A><br>
<A NAME=67>That I have  fined these bones of mine for ransom?</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Comest thou again for ransom?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>MONTJOY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>No, great king:</A><br>
<A NAME=70>I come to thee for charitable licence,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>That we may wander o'er this bloody field</A><br>
<A NAME=72>To look our dead, and then to bury them;</A><br>
<A NAME=73>To sort our nobles from our common men.</A><br>
<A NAME=74>For many of our princes--woe the while!--</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;</A><br>
<A NAME=76>So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs</A><br>
<A NAME=77>In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>To view the field in safety and dispose</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Of their dead bodies!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>I tell thee truly, herald,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>I know not if the day be ours or no;</A><br>
<A NAME=85>For yet a many of your horsemen peer</A><br>
<A NAME=86>And gallop o'er the field.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>MONTJOY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>The day is yours.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!</A><br>
<A NAME=89>What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>MONTJOY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=90>They call it Agincourt.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>Then call we this the field of Agincourt,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your</A><br>
<A NAME=94>majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>fought a most prave pattle here in France.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>They did, Fluellen.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>FLUELLEN</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is</A><br>
<A NAME=99>remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a</A><br>
<A NAME=100>garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this</A><br>
<A NAME=102>hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do</A><br>
<A NAME=103>believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek</A><br>
<A NAME=104>upon Saint Tavy's day.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>KING HENRY V</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=105>I wear it for a memorable honour;</A><br>
<A NAME=106>For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Bring me just notice of the numbers dead</A><br>
<A NAME=118>On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.</A><br>
<p><i>Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy</i></p>

<A NAME=127>o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear</A><br>
