<H3>SCENE V. A room in the Garter Inn.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Bardolph, I say,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>Here, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit BARDOLPH</i></p>
<A NAME=4>Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a</A><br>
<A NAME=5>barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give</A><br>
<A NAME=8>them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues</A><br>
<A NAME=9>slighted me into the river with as little remorse as</A><br>
<A NAME=10>they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size</A><br>
<A NAME=12>that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the</A><br>
<A NAME=13>bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had</A><br>
<A NAME=14>been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and</A><br>
<A NAME=15>shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells</A><br>
<A NAME=16>a man; and what a thing should I have been when I</A><br>
<A NAME=17>had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.</A><br>
<p><i>Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my</A><br>
<A NAME=20>belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for</A><br>
<A NAME=21>pills to cool the reins. Call her in.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=22>Come in, woman!</A><br>
<p><i>Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship</A><br>
<A NAME=24>good morrow.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of</A><br>
<A NAME=26>sack finely.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>BARDOLPH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=27>With eggs, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit BARDOLPH</i></p>
<A NAME=29>How now!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown</A><br>
<A NAME=32>into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:</A><br>
<A NAME=34>she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=35>So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn</A><br>
<A NAME=37>your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning</A><br>
<A NAME=38>a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her</A><br>
<A NAME=39>between eight and nine: I must carry her word</A><br>
<A NAME=40>quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her</A><br>
<A NAME=42>think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>and then judge of my merit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=44>I will tell her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=45>Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>Eight and nine, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>Well, be gone: I will not miss her.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>MISTRESS QUICKLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=48>Peace be with you, sir.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=49>I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word</A><br>
<A NAME=50>to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter FORD</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>Bless you, sir!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed</A><br>
<A NAME=53>between me and Ford's wife?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her</A><br>
<A NAME=56>house the hour she appointed me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>And sped you, sir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>How so, sir? Did she change her determination?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her</A><br>
<A NAME=61>husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual</A><br>
<A NAME=62>'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our</A><br>
<A NAME=63>encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;</A><br>
<A NAME=65>and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither</A><br>
<A NAME=66>provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>What, while you were there?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>While I was there.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>And did he search for you, and could not find you?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes</A><br>
<A NAME=72>in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's</A><br>
<A NAME=73>approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's</A><br>
<A NAME=74>distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>A buck-basket!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul</A><br>
<A NAME=77>shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy</A><br>
<A NAME=78>napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest</A><br>
<A NAME=79>compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>And how long lay you there?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have</A><br>
<A NAME=82>suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's</A><br>
<A NAME=84>knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their</A><br>
<A NAME=85>mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met</A><br>
<A NAME=87>the jealous knave their master in the door, who</A><br>
<A NAME=88>asked them once or twice what they had in their</A><br>
<A NAME=89>basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave</A><br>
<A NAME=90>would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he</A><br>
<A NAME=91>should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he</A><br>
<A NAME=92>for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But</A><br>
<A NAME=93>mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs</A><br>
<A NAME=94>of three several deaths; first, an intolerable</A><br>
<A NAME=95>fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten</A><br>
<A NAME=96>bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good</A><br>
<A NAME=97>bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to</A><br>
<A NAME=98>point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes</A><br>
<A NAME=100>that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a</A><br>
<A NAME=101>man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject</A><br>
<A NAME=102>to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution</A><br>
<A NAME=103>and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And in the height of this bath, when I was more than</A><br>
<A NAME=105>half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be</A><br>
<A NAME=106>thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of</A><br>
<A NAME=108>that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=109>In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you</A><br>
<A NAME=110>have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;</A><br>
<A NAME=111>you'll undertake her no more?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=112>Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have</A><br>
<A NAME=113>been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her</A><br>
<A NAME=114>husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have</A><br>
<A NAME=115>received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt</A><br>
<A NAME=116>eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=117>'Tis past eight already, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>FALSTAFF</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.</A><br>
<A NAME=119>Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall</A><br>
<A NAME=120>know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be</A><br>
<A NAME=121>crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall</A><br>
<A NAME=122>have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall</A><br>
<A NAME=123>cuckold Ford.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>FORD</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=124>Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I</A><br>
<A NAME=125>sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!</A><br>
<A NAME=126>there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.</A><br>
<A NAME=127>This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen</A><br>
<A NAME=128>and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself</A><br>
<A NAME=129>what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my</A><br>
<A NAME=130>house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he</A><br>
<A NAME=131>should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,</A><br>
<A NAME=132>nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that</A><br>
<A NAME=133>guides him should aid him, I will search</A><br>
<A NAME=134>impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,</A><br>
<A NAME=135>yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:</A><br>
<A NAME=136>if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go</A><br>
<A NAME=137>with me: I'll be horn-mad.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
