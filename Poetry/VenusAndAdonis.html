<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Vilia miretur vulgus; mihi flavus Apollo<BR>
Pocula Castalia plena ministret aqua.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
TO THE<BR>
RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY,<BR>
EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, AND BARON OF TICHFIELD.<BR>
RIGHT HONORABLE,<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I KNOW not how I shall offend in dedicating my unpolished lines to<BR>
your lordship, nor how the world will censure me for choosing so<BR>
strong a prop to support so weak a burden only, if your honour seem<BR>
but pleased, I account myself highly praised, and vow to take<BR>
advantage of all idle hours, till I have honoured you with some graver<BR>
labour. But if the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall<BR>
be sorry it had so noble a god-father, and never after ear so barren a<BR>
land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest.  I leave it to your<BR>
honourable survey, and your honour to your heart's content; which I<BR>
wish may always answer your own wish and the world's hopeful<BR>
expectation.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Your honour's in all duty,<BR>
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
EVEN as the sun with purple-colour'd face<BR>
Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,<BR>
Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;<BR>
Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;<BR>
Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,<BR>
And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Thrice-fairer than myself,' thus she began,<BR>
'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,<BR>
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,<BR>
More white and red than doves or roses are;<BR>
Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,<BR>
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,<BR>
And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;<BR>
If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed<BR>
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:<BR>
Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,<BR>
And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,<BR>
But rather famish them amid their plenty,<BR>
Making them red and pale with fresh variety,<BR>
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:<BR>
A summer's day will seem an hour but short,<BR>
Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,<BR>
The precedent of pith and livelihood,<BR>
And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,<BR>
Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:<BR>
Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force<BR>
Courageously to pluck him from his horse.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,<BR>
Under her other was the tender boy,<BR>
Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,<BR>
With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;<BR>
She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,<BR>
He red for shame, but frosty in desire.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The studded bridle on a ragged bough<BR>
Nimbly she fastens:--O, how quick is love!--<BR>
The steed is stalled up, and even now<BR>
To tie the rider she begins to prove:<BR>
Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,<BR>
And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So soon was she along as he was down,<BR>
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:<BR>
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,<BR>
And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;<BR>
And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,<BR>
'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears<BR>
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;<BR>
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs<BR>
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:<BR>
He saith she is immodest, blames her 'miss;<BR>
What follows more she murders with a kiss.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,<BR>
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,<BR>
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,<BR>
Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;<BR>
Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,<BR>
And where she ends she doth anew begin.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Forced to content, but never to obey,<BR>
Panting he lies and breatheth in her face;<BR>
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,<BR>
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;<BR>
Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,<BR>
So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,<BR>
So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;<BR>
Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,<BR>
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:<BR>
Rain added to a river that is rank<BR>
Perforce will force it overflow the bank.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,<BR>
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;<BR>
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,<BR>
'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:<BR>
Being red, she loves him best; and being white,<BR>
Her best is better'd with a more delight.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;<BR>
And by her fair immortal hand she swears,<BR>
From his soft bosom never to remove,<BR>
Till he take truce with her contending tears,<BR>
Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;<BR>
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Upon this promise did he raise his chin,<BR>
Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,<BR>
Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;<BR>
So offers he to give what she did crave;<BR>
But when her lips were ready for his pay,<BR>
He winks, and turns his lips another way.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Never did passenger in summer's heat<BR>
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.<BR>
Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;<BR>
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:<BR>
'O, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy!<BR>
'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,<BR>
Even by the stern and direful god of war,<BR>
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,<BR>
Who conquers where he comes in every jar;<BR>
Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,<BR>
And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Over my altars hath he hung his lance,<BR>
His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,<BR>
And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,<BR>
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,<BR>
Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,<BR>
Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Thus he that overruled I oversway'd,<BR>
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:<BR>
Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,<BR>
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.<BR>
O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,<BR>
For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,--<BR>
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red--<BR>
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.<BR>
What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:<BR>
Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;<BR>
Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?<BR>
'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,<BR>
And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;<BR>
Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;<BR>
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:<BR>
These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean<BR>
Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip<BR>
Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted:<BR>
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;<BR>
Beauty within itself should not be wasted:<BR>
Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime<BR>
Rot and consume themselves in little time.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,<BR>
Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,<BR>
O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,<BR>
Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,<BR>
Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee<BR>
But having no defects, why dost abhor me?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;<BR>
Mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning:<BR>
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,<BR>
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;<BR>
My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,<BR>
Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,<BR>
Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,<BR>
Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,<BR>
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:<BR>
Love is a spirit all compact of fire,<BR>
Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;<BR>
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;<BR>
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,<BR>
From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:<BR>
Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be<BR>
That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?<BR>
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?<BR>
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,<BR>
Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.<BR>
Narcissus so himself himself forsook,<BR>
And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,<BR>
Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,<BR>
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:<BR>
Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:<BR>
Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;<BR>
Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,<BR>
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?<BR>
By law of nature thou art bound to breed,<BR>
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;<BR>
And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,<BR>
In that thy likeness still is left alive.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,<BR>
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,<BR>
And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat,<BR>
With burning eye did hotly overlook them;<BR>
Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,<BR>
So he were like him and by Venus' side.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And now Adonis, with a lazy spright,<BR>
And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,<BR>
His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,<BR>
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,<BR>
Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie, no more of love!<BR>
The sun doth burn my face: I must remove.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind?<BR>
What bare excuses makest thou to be gone!<BR>
I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind<BR>
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:<BR>
I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;<BR>
If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,<BR>
And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:<BR>
The heat I have from thence doth little harm,<BR>
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;<BR>
And were I not immortal, life were done<BR>
Between this heavenly and earthly sun.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,<BR>
Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth?<BR>
Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel<BR>
What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?<BR>
O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,<BR>
She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'What am I, that thou shouldst contemn me this?<BR>
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?<BR>
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?<BR>
Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:<BR>
Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,<BR>
And one for interest, if thou wilt have twain.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,<BR>
Well-painted idol, image dun and dead,<BR>
Statue contenting but the eye alone,<BR>
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!<BR>
Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,<BR>
For men will kiss even by their own direction.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,<BR>
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;<BR>
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;<BR>
Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:<BR>
And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,<BR>
And now her sobs do her intendments break.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,<BR>
Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;<BR>
Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:<BR>
She would, he will not in her arms be bound;<BR>
And when from thence he struggles to be gone,<BR>
She locks her lily fingers one in one.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here<BR>
Within the circuit of this ivory pale,<BR>
I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;<BR>
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:<BR>
Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,<BR>
Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Within this limit is relief enough,<BR>
Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,<BR>
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,<BR>
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain<BR>
Then be my deer, since I am such a park;<BR>
No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,<BR>
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:<BR>
Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,<BR>
He might be buried in a tomb so simple;<BR>
Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,<BR>
Why, there Love lived and there he could not die.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,<BR>
Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.<BR>
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?<BR>
Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?<BR>
Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,<BR>
To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?<BR>
Her words are done, her woes are more increasing;<BR>
The time is spent, her object will away,<BR>
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.<BR>
'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'<BR>
Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,<BR>
A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,<BR>
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,<BR>
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:<BR>
The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,<BR>
Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,<BR>
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;<BR>
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,<BR>
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;<BR>
The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,<BR>
Controlling what he was controlled with.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane<BR>
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;<BR>
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,<BR>
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:<BR>
His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,<BR>
Shows his hot courage and his high desire.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,<BR>
With gentle majesty and modest pride;<BR>
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,<BR>
As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried,<BR>
And this I do to captivate the eye<BR>
Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What recketh he his rider's angry stir,<BR>
His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?<BR>
What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?<BR>
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?<BR>
He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,<BR>
For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Look, when a painter would surpass the life,<BR>
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,<BR>
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,<BR>
As if the dead the living should exceed;<BR>
So did this horse excel a common one<BR>
In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,<BR>
Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,<BR>
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,<BR>
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:<BR>
Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,<BR>
Save a proud rider on so proud a back.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;<BR>
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;<BR>
To bid the wind a base he now prepares,<BR>
And whether he run or fly they know not whether;<BR>
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,<BR>
Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He looks upon his love and neighs unto her;<BR>
She answers him as if she knew his mind:<BR>
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,<BR>
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,<BR>
Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,<BR>
Beating his kind embracements with her heels.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Then, like a melancholy malcontent,<BR>
He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,<BR>
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:<BR>
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.<BR>
His love, perceiving how he is enraged,<BR>
Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
His testy master goeth about to take him;<BR>
When, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear,<BR>
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,<BR>
With her the horse, and left Adonis there:<BR>
As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,<BR>
Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,<BR>
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:<BR>
And now the happy season once more fits,<BR>
That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;<BR>
For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong<BR>
When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,<BR>
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:<BR>
So of concealed sorrow may be said;<BR>
Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;<BR>
But when the heart's attorney once is mute,<BR>
The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He sees her coming, and begins to glow,<BR>
Even as a dying coal revives with wind,<BR>
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;<BR>
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,<BR>
Taking no notice that she is so nigh,<BR>
For all askance he holds her in his eye.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
O, what a sight it was, wistly to view<BR>
How she came stealing to the wayward boy!<BR>
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,<BR>
How white and red each other did destroy!<BR>
But now her cheek was pale, and by and by<BR>
It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now was she just before him as he sat,<BR>
And like a lowly lover down she kneels;<BR>
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,<BR>
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:<BR>
His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,<BR>
As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
O, what a war of looks was then between them!<BR>
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;<BR>
His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;<BR>
Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:<BR>
And all this dumb play had his acts made plain<BR>
With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Full gently now she takes him by the hand,<BR>
A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,<BR>
Or ivory in an alabaster band;<BR>
So white a friend engirts so white a foe:<BR>
This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,<BR>
Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once more the engine of her thoughts began:<BR>
'O fairest mover on this mortal round,<BR>
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,<BR>
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;<BR>
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,<BR>
Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'<BR>
'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it:<BR>
O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,<BR>
And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:<BR>
Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,<BR>
Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;<BR>
My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,<BR>
And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:<BR>
I pray you hence, and leave me here alone;<BR>
For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,<BR>
Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,<BR>
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:<BR>
Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;<BR>
Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:<BR>
The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;<BR>
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,<BR>
Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!<BR>
But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,<BR>
He held such petty bondage in disdain;<BR>
Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,<BR>
Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,<BR>
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,<BR>
But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,<BR>
His other agents aim at like delight?<BR>
Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold<BR>
To touch the fire, the weather being cold?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;<BR>
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,<BR>
To take advantage on presented joy;<BR>
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;<BR>
O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,<BR>
And once made perfect, never lost again.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,<BR>
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;<BR>
'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;<BR>
My love to love is love but to disgrace it;<BR>
For I have heard it is a life in death,<BR>
That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?<BR>
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?<BR>
If springing things be any jot diminish'd,<BR>
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:<BR>
The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young<BR>
Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,<BR>
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:<BR>
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;<BR>
To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:<BR>
Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;<BR>
For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?<BR>
O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!<BR>
Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;<BR>
I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:<BR>
Melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,<BR>
Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love<BR>
That inward beauty and invisible;<BR>
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move<BR>
Each part in me that were but sensible:<BR>
Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,<BR>
Yet should I be in love by touching thee.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,<BR>
And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,<BR>
And nothing but the very smell were left me,<BR>
Yet would my love to thee be still as much;<BR>
For from the stillitory of thy face excelling<BR>

smelling.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'But, O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,<BR>
Being nurse and feeder of the other four!<BR>
Would they not wish the feast might ever last,<BR>
And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,<BR>
Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,<BR>
Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,<BR>
Which to his speech did honey passage yield;<BR>
Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd<BR>
Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,<BR>
Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,<BR>
Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This ill presage advisedly she marketh:<BR>
Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,<BR>
Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,<BR>
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,<BR>
Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,<BR>
His meaning struck her ere his words begun.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And at his look she flatly falleth down,<BR>
For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;<BR>
A smile recures the wounding of a frown;<BR>
But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!<BR>
The silly boy, believing she is dead,<BR>
Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And all amazed brake off his late intent,<BR>
For sharply he did think to reprehend her,<BR>
Which cunning love did wittily prevent:<BR>
Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!<BR>
For on the grass she lies as she were slain,<BR>
Till his breath breatheth life in her again.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,<BR>
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,<BR>
He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks<BR>
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:<BR>
He kisses her; and she, by her good will,<BR>
Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:<BR>
Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,<BR>
Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array<BR>
He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;<BR>
And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,<BR>
So is her face illumined with her eye;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,<BR>
As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.<BR>
Were never four such lamps together mix'd,<BR>
Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;<BR>
But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,<BR>
Shone like the moon in water seen by night.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'O, where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,<BR>
Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?<BR>
What hour is this? or morn or weary even?<BR>
Do I delight to die, or life desire?<BR>
But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;<BR>
But now I died, and death was lively joy.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again:<BR>
Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,<BR>
Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain<BR>
That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;<BR>
And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,<BR>
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!<BR>
O, never let their crimson liveries wear!<BR>
And as they last, their verdure still endure,<BR>
To drive infection from the dangerous year!<BR>
That the star-gazers, having writ on death,<BR>
May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,<BR>
What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?<BR>
To sell myself I can be well contented,<BR>
So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;<BR>
Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips<BR>
Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;<BR>
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.<BR>
What is ten hundred touches unto thee?<BR>
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?<BR>
Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,<BR>
Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,<BR>
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:<BR>
Before I know myself, seek not to know me;<BR>
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:<BR>
The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,<BR>
Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,<BR>
His day's hot task hath ended in the west;<BR>
The owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''Tis very late;'<BR>
The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,<BR>
And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light<BR>
Do summon us to part and bid good night.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;<BR>
If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'<BR>
'Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'<BR>
The honey fee of parting tender'd is:<BR>
Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;<BR>
Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew<BR>
The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,<BR>
Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,<BR>
Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:<BR>
He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth<BR>
Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,<BR>
And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;<BR>
Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,<BR>
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;<BR>
Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,<BR>
That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry:<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,<BR>
With blindfold fury she begins to forage;<BR>
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,<BR>
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,<BR>
Planting oblivion, beating reason back,<BR>
Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,<BR>
Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,<BR>
Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,<BR>
Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,<BR>
He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,<BR>
While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,<BR>
And yields at last to every light impression?<BR>
Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,<BR>
Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:<BR>
Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,<BR>
But then woos best when most his choice is froward.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,<BR>
Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.<BR>
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;<BR>
What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd:<BR>
Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,<BR>
Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For pity now she can no more detain him;<BR>
The poor fool prays her that he may depart:<BR>
She is resolved no longer to restrain him;<BR>
Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,<BR>
The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,<BR>
He carries thence incaged in his breast.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,<BR>
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.<BR>
Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?<BR>
Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'<BR>
He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends<BR>
To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,<BR>
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,<BR>
Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,<BR>
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:<BR>
She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,<BR>
He on her belly falls, she on her back.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now is she in the very lists of love,<BR>
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:<BR>
All is imaginary she doth prove,<BR>
He will not manage her, although he mount her;<BR>
That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,<BR>
To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,<BR>
Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,<BR>
Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,<BR>
As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.<BR>
The warm effects which she in him finds missing<BR>
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
But all in vain; good queen, it will not be:<BR>
She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;<BR>
Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee;<BR>
She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.<BR>
'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;<BR>
You have no reason to withhold me so.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,<BR>
But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.<BR>
O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is<BR>
With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,<BR>
Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,<BR>
Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'On his bow-back he hath a battle set<BR>
Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;<BR>
His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;<BR>
His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;<BR>
Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,<BR>
And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,<BR>
Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;<BR>
His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;<BR>
Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:<BR>
The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,<BR>
As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,<BR>
To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;<BR>
Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,<BR>
Whose full perfection all the world amazes;<BR>
But having thee at vantage,--wondrous dread!--<BR>
Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;<BR>
Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:<BR>
Come not within his danger by thy will;<BR>
They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.<BR>
When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,<BR>
I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?<BR>
Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?<BR>
Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright?<BR>
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,<BR>
My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,<BR>
But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy<BR>
Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;<BR>
Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,<BR>
And in a peaceful hour doth cry 'Kill, kill!'<BR>
Distempering gentle Love in his desire,<BR>
As air and water do abate the fire.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,<BR>
This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,<BR>
This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,<BR>

That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye<BR>
The picture of an angry-chafing boar,<BR>
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie<BR>
An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;<BR>
Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed<BR>
Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,<BR>
That tremble at the imagination?<BR>
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,<BR>

If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.<BR>

'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;<BR>
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,<BR>

And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy<BR>
hounds.<BR>

'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,<BR>
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles<BR>

Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,<BR>
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,<BR>
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,<BR>
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,<BR>

Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'For there his smell with others being mingled,<BR>
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,<BR>
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled<BR>
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;<BR>

As if another chase were in the skies.<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,<BR>
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,<BR>
To harken if his foes pursue him still:<BR>

To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.<BR>

'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch<BR>
Turn, and return, indenting with the way;<BR>

And being low never relieved by any.<BR>

'Lie quietly, and hear a little more;<BR>
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:<BR>

Applying this to that, and so to so;<BR>
For love can comment upon every woe.<BR>

'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he,<BR>
'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:<BR>
The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.<BR>
'I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;<BR>
And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'<BR>
'In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all<BR>

'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this,<BR>
The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,<BR>

Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips<BR>
Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,<BR>
Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.<BR>

'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:<BR>
Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,<BR>

To shame the sun by day and her by night.<BR>

'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies<BR>

Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,<BR>

Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.<BR>

'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,<BR>
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,<BR>

Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.<BR>

When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,<BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,<BR>
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,<BR>
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;<BR>
Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.<BR>
Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,<BR>
So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Which after him she darts, as one on shore<BR>
Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,<BR>
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,<BR>
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:<BR>
So did the merciless and pitchy night<BR>
Fold in the object that did feed her sight.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whereat amazed, as one that unaware<BR>
Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,<BR>
Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,<BR>
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,<BR>
Even so confounded in the dark she lay,<BR>
Having lost the fair discovery of her way.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,<BR>
That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,<BR>
Make verbal repetition of her moans;<BR>
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:<BR>
'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'Woe, woe!'<BR>
And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
She marking them begins a wailing note<BR>
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;<BR>
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;<BR>
How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty:<BR>
Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,<BR>
And still the choir of echoes answer so.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Her song was tedious and outwore the night,<BR>
For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:<BR>
If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight<BR>
In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:<BR>
Their copious stories oftentimes begun<BR>
End without audience and are never done.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For who hath she to spend the night withal<BR>
But idle sounds resembling parasites,<BR>
Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,<BR>
Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?<BR>
She says ''Tis so:' they answer all ''Tis so;'<BR>
And would say after her, if she said 'No.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,<BR>
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,<BR>
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast<BR>
The sun ariseth in his majesty;<BR>
Who doth the world so gloriously behold<BR>
That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:<BR>
'O thou clear god, and patron of all light,<BR>
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow<BR>
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,<BR>
There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,<BR>
May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,<BR>
Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,<BR>
And yet she hears no tidings of her love:<BR>
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:<BR>
Anon she hears them chant it lustily,<BR>
And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And as she runs, the bushes in the way<BR>
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,<BR>
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:<BR>
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,<BR>
Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,<BR>
Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;<BR>
Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder<BR>
Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,<BR>
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;<BR>
Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds<BR>
Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
For now she knows it is no gentle chase,<BR>
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,<BR>
Because the cry remaineth in one place,<BR>
Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:<BR>
Finding their enemy to be so curst,<BR>
They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,<BR>
Through which it enters to surprise her heart;<BR>
Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,<BR>
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:<BR>
Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,<BR>
They basely fly and dare not stay the field.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;<BR>
Till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,<BR>
She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,<BR>
And childish error, that they are afraid;<BR>
Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:--<BR>
And with that word she spied the hunted boar,<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,<BR>
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,<BR>
A second fear through all her sinews spread,<BR>
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:<BR>
This way runs, and now she will no further,<BR>
But back retires to rate the boar for murther.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;<BR>
She treads the path that she untreads again;<BR>
Her more than haste is mated with delays,<BR>
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,<BR>
Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;<BR>
In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,<BR>
And asks the weary caitiff for his master,<BR>
And there another licking of his wound,<BR>
'Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;<BR>
And here she meets another sadly scowling,<BR>
To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,<BR>
Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,<BR>
Against the welkin volleys out his voice;<BR>
Another and another answer him,<BR>
Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,<BR>
Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Look, how the world's poor people are amazed<BR>
At apparitions, signs and prodigies,<BR>
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,<BR>
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;<BR>
So she at these sad signs draws up her breath<BR>
And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,<BR>
Hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she Death,--<BR>
'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean<BR>
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,<BR>
Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set<BR>
Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'If he be dead,--O no, it cannot be,<BR>
Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:--<BR>
O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,<BR>
But hatefully at random dost thou hit.<BR>
Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart<BR>
Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,<BR>
And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.<BR>
The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;<BR>
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:<BR>
Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,<BR>
And not Death's ebon dart, to strike dead.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?<BR>
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?<BR>
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping<BR>
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?<BR>
Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,<BR>
Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Here overcome, as one full of despair,<BR>
She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt<BR>
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair<BR>
In the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;<BR>
But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,<BR>
And with his strong course opens them again.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!<BR>
Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;<BR>
Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,<BR>
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;<BR>
But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,<BR>
Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Variable passions throng her constant woe,<BR>
As striving who should best become her grief;<BR>
All entertain'd, each passion labours so,<BR>
That every present sorrow seemeth chief,<BR>
But none is best: then join they all together,<BR>
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;<BR>
A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well:<BR>
The dire imagination she did follow<BR>
This sound of hope doth labour to expel;<BR>
For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,<BR>
And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,<BR>
Being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;<BR>
Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,<BR>
Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,<BR>
To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,<BR>
Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
O hard-believing love, how strange it seems<BR>
Not to believe, and yet too credulous!<BR>
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;<BR>
Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:<BR>
The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,<BR>
In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;<BR>
Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;<BR>
It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught:<BR>
Now she adds honours to his hateful name;<BR>
She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,<BR>
Imperious supreme of all mortal things.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;<BR>
Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear<BR>
When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,<BR>
Which knows no pity, but is still severe;<BR>
Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess,--<BR>
I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue;<BR>
Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;<BR>
'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;<BR>
I did but act, he's author of thy slander:<BR>
Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet<BR>
Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,<BR>
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;<BR>
And that his beauty may the better thrive,<BR>
With Death she humbly doth insinuate;<BR>
Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories<BR>
His victories, his triumphs and his glories.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I<BR>
To be of such a weak and silly mind<BR>
To wail his death who lives and must not die<BR>
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!<BR>
For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,<BR>
And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear<BR>
As one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;<BR>
Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,<BR>
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'<BR>
Even at this word she hears a merry horn,<BR>
Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As falcon to the lure, away she flies;<BR>
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;<BR>
And in her haste unfortunately spies<BR>
The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;<BR>
Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,<BR>
Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,<BR>
Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,<BR>
And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,<BR>
Long after fearing to creep forth again;<BR>
So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled<BR>
Into the deep dark cabins of her head:<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Where they resign their office and their light<BR>
To the disposing of her troubled brain;<BR>
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,<BR>
And never wound the heart with looks again;<BR>
Who like a king perplexed in his throne,<BR>
By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Whereat each tributary subject quakes;<BR>
As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,<BR>
Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,<BR>
Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.<BR>
This mutiny each part doth so surprise<BR>
That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And, being open'd, threw unwilling light<BR>
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd<BR>
In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white<BR>
With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:<BR>
No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,<BR>
But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth;<BR>
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;<BR>
Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;<BR>
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:<BR>
Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;<BR>
Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,<BR>
That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;<BR>
And then she reprehends her mangling eye,<BR>
That makes more gashes where no breach should be:<BR>
His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;<BR>
For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,<BR>
And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!<BR>
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,<BR>
Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:<BR>
Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!<BR>
So shall I die by drops of hot desire.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!<BR>
What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?<BR>
Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast<BR>
Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?<BR>
The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;<BR>
But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!<BR>
Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:<BR>
Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;<BR>
The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you:<BR>
But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air<BR>
Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'And therefore would he put his bonnet on,<BR>
Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;<BR>
The wind would blow it off and, being gone,<BR>
Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;<BR>
And straight, in pity of his tender years,<BR>
They both would strive who first should dry his tears.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'To see his face the lion walk'd along<BR>
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;<BR>
To recreate himself when he hath sung,<BR>
The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;<BR>
If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey<BR>
And never fright the silly lamb that day.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'When he beheld his shadow in the brook,<BR>
The fishes spread on it their golden gills;<BR>
When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,<BR>
That some would sing, some other in their bills<BR>
Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries;<BR>
He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,<BR>
Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,<BR>
Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;<BR>
Witness the entertainment that he gave:<BR>
If he did see his face, why then I know<BR>
He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:<BR>
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,<BR>
Who did not whet his teeth at him again,<BR>
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;<BR>
And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine<BR>
Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,<BR>
With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;<BR>
But he is dead, and never did he bless<BR>
My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'<BR>
With this, she falleth in the place she stood,<BR>
And stains her face with his congealed blood.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;<BR>
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;<BR>
She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,<BR>
As if they heard the woeful words she told;<BR>
She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,<BR>
Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two glasses, where herself herself beheld<BR>
A thousand times, and now no more reflect;<BR>
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,<BR>
And every beauty robb'd of his effect:<BR>
'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,<BR>
That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy:<BR>
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:<BR>
It shall be waited on with jealousy,<BR>
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,<BR>
Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,<BR>
That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,<BR>
Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;<BR>
The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd<BR>
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:<BR>
The strongest body shall it make most weak,<BR>
Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,<BR>
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;<BR>
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,<BR>
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;<BR>
It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,<BR>
Make the young old, the old become a child.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;<BR>
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;<BR>
It shall be merciful and too severe,<BR>
And most deceiving when it seems most just;<BR>
Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,<BR>
Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'It shall be cause of war and dire events,<BR>
And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;<BR>
Subject and servile to all discontents,<BR>
As dry combustious matter is to fire:<BR>
Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,<BR>
They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd<BR>
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,<BR>
And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,<BR>
A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,<BR>
Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood<BR>
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,<BR>
Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,<BR>
And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,<BR>
Since he himself is reft from her by death:<BR>
She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears<BR>
Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise--<BR>
Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire--<BR>
For every little grief to wet his eyes:<BR>
To grow unto himself was his desire,<BR>
And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good<BR>
To wither in my breast as in his blood.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;<BR>
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:<BR>
Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,<BR>
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:<BR>
There shall not be one minute in an hour<BR>
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Thus weary of the world, away she hies,<BR>
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid<BR>
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies<BR>
In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;<BR>
Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen<BR>
Means to immure herself and not be seen.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
