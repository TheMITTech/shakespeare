<H3>SCENE IV. Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA, and others</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>And by relating tales of others' griefs,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;</A><br>
<A NAME=5>For who digs hills because they do aspire</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.</A><br>
<A NAME=7>O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=9>But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=10>O Dionyza,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;</A><br>
<A NAME=16>That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,</A><br>
<A NAME=17>They may awake their helps to comfort them.</A><br>
<A NAME=18>I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>I'll do my best, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>A city on whom plenty held full hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;</A><br>
<A NAME=24>Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Like one another's glass to trim them by:</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,</A><br>
<A NAME=29>And not so much to feed on as delight;</A><br>
<A NAME=30>All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>The name of help grew odious to repeat.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>O, 'tis too true.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>But see what heaven can do! By this our change,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Were all too little to content and please,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Although they gave their creatures in abundance,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>As houses are defiled for want of use,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>They are now starved for want of exercise:</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Must have inventions to delight the taste,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Thought nought too curious, are ready now</A><br>
<A NAME=44>To eat those little darlings whom they loved.</A><br>
<A NAME=45>So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Here many sink, yet those which see them fall</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Have scarce strength left to give them burial.</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Is not this true?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>O, let those cities that of plenty's cup</A><br>
<A NAME=53>And her prosperities so largely taste,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!</A><br>
<A NAME=55>The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Lord</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>Where's the lord governor?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>Here.</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>For comfort is too far for us to expect.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>A portly sail of ships make hitherward.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>I thought as much.</A><br>
<A NAME=63>One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>That may succeed as his inheritor;</A><br>
<A NAME=65>And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Taking advantage of our misery,</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>To beat us down, the which are down already;</A><br>
<A NAME=69>And make a conquest of unhappy me,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Whereas no glory's got to overcome.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>That's the least fear; for, by the semblance</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>And come to us as favourers, not as foes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=74>Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.</A><br>
<A NAME=76>But bring they what they will and what they can,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>What need we fear?</A><br>
<A NAME=78>The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Go tell their general we attend him here,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And what he craves.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>I go, my lord.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;</A><br>
<A NAME=84>If wars, we are unable to resist.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter PERICLES with Attendants</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>PERICLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>Lord governor, for so we hear you are,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Let not our ships and number of our men</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.</A><br>
<A NAME=88>We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,</A><br>
<A NAME=89>And seen the desolation of your streets:</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,</A><br>
<A NAME=91>But to relieve them of their heavy load;</A><br>
<A NAME=92>And these our ships, you happily may think</A><br>
<A NAME=93>Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within</A><br>
<A NAME=94>With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>All</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>The gods of Greece protect you!</A><br>
<A NAME=98>And we'll pray for you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>PERICLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=99>Arise, I pray you, rise:</A><br>
<A NAME=100>We do not look for reverence, but to love,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>The which when any shall not gratify,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=105>The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!</A><br>
<A NAME=106>Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Your grace is welcome to our town and us.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>PERICLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter GOWER</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=110>Here have you seen a mighty king</A><br>
<A NAME=111>His child, I wis, to incest bring;</A><br>
<A NAME=112>A better prince and benign lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=113>That will prove awful both in deed and word.</A><br>
<A NAME=114>Be quiet then as men should be,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Till he hath pass'd necessity.</A><br>
<A NAME=116>I'll show you those in troubles reign,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>Losing a mite, a mountain gain.</A><br>
<A NAME=118>The good in conversation,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>To whom I give my benison,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Is still at Tarsus, where each man</A><br>
<A NAME=121>Thinks all is writ he speken can;</A><br>
<A NAME=122>And, to remember what he does,</A><br>
<A NAME=123>Build his statue to make him glorious:</A><br>
<A NAME=124>But tidings to the contrary</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?</A><br>
<A NAME=126>DUMB SHOW.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all  the train with them. Enter at another door a  Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES  shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a  reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one door, and CLEON at another</i></p>
<A NAME=127>Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Not to eat honey like a drone</A><br>
<A NAME=129>From others' labours; for though he strive</A><br>
<A NAME=130>To killen bad, keep good alive;</A><br>
<A NAME=131>And to fulfil his prince' desire,</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:</A><br>
<A NAME=133>How Thaliard came full bent with sin</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And had intent to murder him;</A><br>
<A NAME=135>And that in Tarsus was not best</A><br>
<A NAME=136>Longer for him to make his rest.</A><br>
<A NAME=137>He, doing so, put forth to seas,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Where when men been, there's seldom ease;</A><br>
<A NAME=139>For now the wind begins to blow;</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Thunder above and deeps below</A><br>
<A NAME=141>Make such unquiet, that the ship</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;</A><br>
<A NAME=143>And he, good prince, having all lost,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>By waves from coast to coast is tost:</A><br>
<A NAME=145>All perishen of man, of pelf,</A><br>
<A NAME=146>Ne aught escapen but himself;</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Till fortune, tired with doing bad,</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Threw him ashore, to give him glad:</A><br>
<A NAME=149>And here he comes. What shall be next,</A><br>
<A NAME=150>Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.</A><br>
