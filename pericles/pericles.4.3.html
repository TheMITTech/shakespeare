<H3>SCENE III. Tarsus. A room in CLEON's house.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter CLEON and DIONYZA</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter</A><br>
<A NAME=3>The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>I think</A><br>
<A NAME=5>You'll turn a child again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess</A><br>
<A NAME=9>To equal any single crown o' the earth</A><br>
<A NAME=10>I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!</A><br>
<A NAME=11>Whom thou hast poison'd too:</A><br>
<A NAME=12>If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say</A><br>
<A NAME=14>When noble Pericles shall demand his child?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>To foster it, nor ever to preserve.</A><br>
<A NAME=17>She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Unless you play the pious innocent,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>And for an honest attribute cry out</A><br>
<A NAME=20>'She died by foul play.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>O, go to. Well, well,</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Do like this worst.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>Be one of those that think</A><br>
<A NAME=25>The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>And open this to Pericles. I do shame</A><br>
<A NAME=27>To think of what a noble strain you are,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And of how coward a spirit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>To such proceeding</A><br>
<A NAME=30>Who ever but his approbation added,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Though not his prime consent, he did not flow</A><br>
<A NAME=32>From honourable sources.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>Be it so, then:</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.</A><br>
<A NAME=36>She did disdain my child, and stood between</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>But cast their gazes on Marina's face;</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;</A><br>
<A NAME=41>And though you call my course unnatural,</A><br>
<A NAME=42>You not your child well loving, yet I find</A><br>
<A NAME=43>It greets me as an enterprise of kindness</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Perform'd to your sole daughter.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=45>Heavens forgive it!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=46>And as for Pericles,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>What should he say? We wept after her hearse,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>And yet we mourn: her monument</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs</A><br>
<A NAME=50>In glittering golden characters express</A><br>
<A NAME=51>A general praise to her, and care in us</A><br>
<A NAME=52>At whose expense 'tis done.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>CLEON</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=53>Thou art like the harpy,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Seize with thine eagle's talons.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>DIONYZA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=56>You are like one that superstitiously</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:</A><br>
<A NAME=58>But yet I know you'll do as I advise.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<A NAME=59>SCENE IV:</A><br>
<p><i>Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>GOWER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Making, to take your imagination,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>From bourn to bourn, region to region.</A><br>
<A NAME=64>By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime</A><br>
<A NAME=65>To use one language in each several clime</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you</A><br>
<A NAME=67>To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>The stages of our story. Pericles</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Attended on by many a lord and knight.</A><br>
<A NAME=71>To see his daughter, all his life's delight.</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Advanced in time to great and high estate,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Old Helicanus goes along behind.</A><br>
<A NAME=76>Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought</A><br>
<A NAME=77>This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;</A><br>
<A NAME=78>So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--</A><br>
<A NAME=79>To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.</A><br>
<A NAME=82>DUMB SHOW.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;  CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows  PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes  lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA</i></p>
<A NAME=83>See how belief may suffer by foul show!</A><br>
<A NAME=84>This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;</A><br>
<A NAME=85>And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>With sighs shot through, and biggest tears</A><br>
<A NAME=87>o'ershower'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:</A><br>
<A NAME=90>He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears</A><br>
<A NAME=91>A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.</A><br>
<A NAME=93>The epitaph is for Marina writ</A><br>
<A NAME=94>By wicked Dionyza.</A><br>
<p><i>Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument</i></p>
<A NAME=95>'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Who wither'd in her spring of year.</A><br>
<A NAME=97>She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'</A><br>
<A NAME=105>No visor does become black villany</A><br>
<A NAME=106>So well as soft and tender flattery.</A><br>
<A NAME=107>Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>And bear his courses to be ordered</A><br>
<A NAME=109>By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play</A><br>
<A NAME=110>His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day</A><br>
<A NAME=111>In her unholy service. Patience, then,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>And think you now are all in Mytilene.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
