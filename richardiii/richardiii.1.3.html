<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Will soon recover his accustom'd health.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>GREY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,</A><br>
<A NAME=5>And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>If he were dead, what would betide of me?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>No other harm but loss of such a lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>The loss of such a lord includes all harm.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>GREY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>To be your comforter when he is gone.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>Oh, he is young and his minority</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>A man that loves not me, nor none of you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>Is it concluded that he shall be protector?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>It is determined, not concluded yet:</A><br>
<A NAME=16>But so it must be, if the king miscarry.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>GREY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>Good time of day unto your royal grace!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>DERBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>God make your majesty joyful as you have been!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.</A><br>
<A NAME=21>To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured</A><br>
<A NAME=24>I hate not you for her proud arrogance.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>DERBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>I do beseech you, either not believe</A><br>
<A NAME=26>The envious slanders of her false accusers;</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Or, if she be accused in true report,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds</A><br>
<A NAME=29>From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>DERBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=31>But now the Duke of Buckingham and I</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Are come from visiting his majesty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>What likelihood of his amendment, lords?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=34>Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=35>God grant him health! Did you confer with him?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;</A><br>
<A NAME=39>And sent to warn them to his royal presence.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Would all were well! but that will never be</A><br>
<A NAME=41>I fear our happiness is at the highest.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Who are they that complain unto the king,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?</A><br>
<A NAME=45>By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly</A><br>
<A NAME=46>That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>I must be held a rancorous enemy.</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>But thus his simple truth must be abused</A><br>
<A NAME=53>By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.</A><br>
<A NAME=56>When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?</A><br>
<A NAME=58>A plague upon you all! His royal person,--</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,</A><br>
<A NAME=61>But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.</A><br>
<A NAME=63>The king, of his own royal disposition,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>And not provoked by any suitor else;</A><br>
<A NAME=65>Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Which in your outward actions shows itself</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather</A><br>
<A NAME=69>The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Since every Jack became a gentleman</A><br>
<A NAME=73>There's many a gentle person made a Jack.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=74>Come, come, we know your meaning, brother</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Gloucester;</A><br>
<A NAME=76>You envy my advancement and my friends':</A><br>
<A NAME=77>God grant we never may have need of you!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Your brother is imprison'd by your means,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Myself disgraced, and the nobility</A><br>
<A NAME=81>Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Are daily given to ennoble those</A><br>
<A NAME=83>That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>By Him that raised me to this careful height</A><br>
<A NAME=85>From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>I never did incense his majesty</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been</A><br>
<A NAME=88>An earnest advocate to plead for him.</A><br>
<A NAME=89>My lord, you do me shameful injury,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>You may deny that you were not the cause</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>She may, my lord, for--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=94>She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?</A><br>
<A NAME=95>She may do more, sir, than denying that:</A><br>
<A NAME=96>She may help you to many fair preferments,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>And then deny her aiding hand therein,</A><br>
<A NAME=98>And lay those honours on your high deserts.</A><br>
<A NAME=99>What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>What, marry, may she?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=101>What, marry, may she! marry with a king,</A><br>
<A NAME=102>A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:</A><br>
<A NAME=103>I wis your grandam had a worser match.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=104>My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:</A><br>
<A NAME=106>By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty</A><br>
<A NAME=107>With those gross taunts I often have endured.</A><br>
<A NAME=108>I had rather be a country servant-maid</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Than a great queen, with this condition,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:</A><br>
<p><i>Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind</i></p>
<A NAME=111>Small joy have I in being England's queen.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=112>And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>What! threat you me with telling of the king?</A><br>
<A NAME=115>Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said</A><br>
<A NAME=116>I will avouch in presence of the king:</A><br>
<A NAME=117>I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.</A><br>
<A NAME=118>'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>Out, devil! I remember them too well:</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=122>Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,</A><br>
<A NAME=123>I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;</A><br>
<A NAME=124>A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,</A><br>
<A NAME=125>A liberal rewarder of his friends:</A><br>
<A NAME=126>To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=127>Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=128>In all which time you and your husband Grey</A><br>
<A NAME=129>Were factious for the house of Lancaster;</A><br>
<A NAME=130>And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband</A><br>
<A NAME=131>In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Let me put in your minds, if you forget,</A><br>
<A NAME=133>What you have been ere now, and what you are;</A><br>
<A NAME=134>Withal, what I have been, and what I am.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>A murderous villain, and so still thou art.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=136>Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;</A><br>
<A NAME=137>Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=138>Which God revenge!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>To fight on Edward's party for the crown;</A><br>
<A NAME=140>And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.</A><br>
<A NAME=141>I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;</A><br>
<A NAME=142>Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine</A><br>
<A NAME=143>I am too childish-foolish for this world.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=146>My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Which here you urge to prove us enemies,</A><br>
<A NAME=148>We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:</A><br>
<A NAME=149>So should we you, if you should be our king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=150>If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:</A><br>
<A NAME=151>Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=152>As little joy, my lord, as you suppose</A><br>
<A NAME=153>You should enjoy, were you this country's king,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>As little joy may you suppose in me.</A><br>
<A NAME=155>That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech50><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;</A><br>
<A NAME=157>For I am she, and altogether joyless.</A><br>
<A NAME=158>I can no longer hold me patient.</A><br>
<p><i>Advancing</i></p>
<A NAME=159>Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out</A><br>
<A NAME=160>In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Which of you trembles not that looks on me?</A><br>
<A NAME=162>If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?</A><br>
<A NAME=164>O gentle villain, do not turn away!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech51><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=165>Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=166>But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=167>That will I make before I let thee go.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=168>Wert thou not banished on pain of death?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=169>I was; but I do find more pain in banishment</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Than death can yield me here by my abode.</A><br>
<A NAME=171>A husband and a son thou owest to me;</A><br>
<A NAME=172>And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:</A><br>
<A NAME=173>The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,</A><br>
<A NAME=174>And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=175>The curse my noble father laid on thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=176>When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper</A><br>
<A NAME=177>And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=178>And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout</A><br>
<A NAME=179>Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--</A><br>
<A NAME=180>His curses, then from bitterness of soul</A><br>
<A NAME=181>Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;</A><br>
<A NAME=182>And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>QUEEN ELIZABETH</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=183>So just is God, to right the innocent.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>HASTINGS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=184>O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,</A><br>
<A NAME=185>And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech58><b>RIVERS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=186>Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech59><b>DORSET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=187>No man but prophesied revenge for it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=188>Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>QUEEN MARGARET</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=189>What were you snarling all before I came,</A><br>
<A NAME=190>Ready to catch each other by the throat,</A><br>
<A NAME=191>And turn you all your hatred now on me?</A><br>
<A NAME=192>Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?</A><br>
<A NAME=193>That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,</A><br>
<A NAME=194>Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,</A><br>
<A NAME=195>Could all but answer for that peevish brat?</A><br>
<A NAME=196>Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?</A><br>
<A NAME=197>Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!</A><br>
<A NAME=198>If not by war, by surfeit die your king,</A><br>

<A NAME=201>For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,</A><br>
<A NAME=202>Die in his youth by like untimely violence!</A><br>
<A NAME=203>Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,</A><br>
<A NAME=204>Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!</A><br>
<A NAME=205>Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;</A><br>
<A NAME=206>And see another, as I see thee now,</A><br>
<A NAME=207>Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!</A><br>
<A NAME=208>Long die thy happy days before thy death;</A><br>
<A NAME=209>And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,</A><br>
<A NAME=210>Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!</A><br>
<A NAME=211>Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,</A><br>
<A NAME=212>And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son</A><br>
<A NAME=213>Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,</A><br>
<A NAME=214>That none of you may live your natural age,</A><br>
<A NAME=215>But by some unlook'd accident cut off!</A><br>
