<H3>SCENE VII. Baynard's Castle.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>How now, my lord, what say the citizens?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>The citizens are mum and speak not a word.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=4>Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>And his contract by deputy in France;</A><br>
<A NAME=7>The insatiate greediness of his desires,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>And his enforcement of the city wives;</A><br>
<A NAME=9>His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>As being got, your father then in France,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>His resemblance, being not like the duke;</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Withal I did infer your lineaments,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Being the right idea of your father,</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Both in your form and nobleness of mind;</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Laid open all your victories in Scotland,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:</A><br>
<A NAME=18>Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose</A><br>
<A NAME=19>Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse</A><br>
<A NAME=20>And when mine oratory grew to an end</A><br>
<A NAME=21>I bid them that did love their country's good</A><br>
<A NAME=22>Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=23>Ah! and did they so?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>No, so God help me, they spake not a word;</A><br>
<A NAME=25>But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,</A><br>
<A NAME=26>Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Which when I saw, I reprehended them;</A><br>
<A NAME=28>And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:</A><br>
<A NAME=29>His answer was, the people were not wont</A><br>
<A NAME=30>To be spoke to but by the recorder.</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Then he was urged to tell my tale again,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'</A><br>
<A NAME=33>But nothing spake in warrant from himself.</A><br>
<A NAME=34>When he had done, some followers of mine own,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'</A><br>
<A NAME=37>And thus I took the vantage of those few,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;</A><br>
<A NAME=39>'This general applause and loving shout</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'</A><br>
<A NAME=41>And even here brake off, and came away.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>No, by my troth, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=44>Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=45>The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:</A><br>
<A NAME=47>And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=48>And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;</A><br>
<A NAME=49>For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:</A><br>
<A NAME=50>And be not easily won to our request:</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>I go; and if you plead as well for them</A><br>
<A NAME=53>As I can say nay to thee for myself,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit GLOUCESTER</i></p>
<p><i>Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens</i></p>
<A NAME=56>Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;</A><br>
<A NAME=57>I think the duke will not be spoke withal.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter CATESBY</i></p>
<A NAME=58>Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,</A><br>
<A NAME=59>What says he?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>CATESBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>             My lord: he doth entreat your grace;</A><br>
<A NAME=61>To visit him to-morrow or next day:</A><br>
<A NAME=62>He is within, with two right reverend fathers,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>Divinely bent to meditation;</A><br>
<A NAME=64>And no worldly suit would he be moved,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>To draw him from his holy exercise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>In deep designs and matters of great moment,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>No less importing than our general good,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Are come to have some conference with his grace.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>CATESBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>I'll tell him what you say, my lord.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=72>Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!</A><br>
<A NAME=73>He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>But on his knees at meditation;</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>But meditating with two deep divines;</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,</A><br>
<A NAME=78>But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Happy were England, would this gracious prince</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:</A><br>
<A NAME=81>But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Lord Mayor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>I fear he will.</A><br>
<p><i>Re-enter CATESBY</i></p>
<A NAME=84>How now, Catesby, what says your lord?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>CATESBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>My lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>He wonders to what end you have assembled</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Such troops of citizens to speak with him,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>His grace not being warn'd thereof before:</A><br>
<A NAME=89>My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=90>Sorry I am my noble cousin should</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:</A><br>
<A NAME=92>By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;</A><br>
<A NAME=93>And so once more return and tell his grace.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit CATESBY</i></p>
<A NAME=94>When holy and devout religious men</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,</A><br>
<A NAME=96>So sweet is zealous contemplation.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops. CATESBY returns</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>Lord Mayor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>See, where he stands between two clergymen!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>To stay him from the fall of vanity:</A><br>
<A NAME=100>And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>True ornaments to know a holy man.</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>Lend favourable ears to our request;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>And pardon us the interruption</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=106>My lord, there needs no such apology:</A><br>
<A NAME=107>I rather do beseech you pardon me,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>Who, earnest in the service of my God,</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Neglect the visitation of my friends.</A><br>
<A NAME=110>But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=111>Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,</A><br>
<A NAME=112>And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>I do suspect I have done some offence</A><br>
<A NAME=114>That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>At our entreaties, to amend that fault!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>Then know, it is your fault that you resign</A><br>
<A NAME=120>The supreme seat, the throne majestical,</A><br>
<A NAME=121>The scepter'd office of your ancestors,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Your state of fortune and your due of birth,</A><br>
<A NAME=123>The lineal glory of your royal house,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>To the corruption of a blemished stock:</A><br>
<A NAME=125>Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>Which here we waken to our country's good,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Her face defaced with scars of infamy,</A><br>
<A NAME=129>Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,</A><br>
<A NAME=130>And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf</A><br>
<A NAME=131>Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Which to recure, we heartily solicit</A><br>
<A NAME=133>Your gracious self to take on you the charge</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And kingly government of this your land,</A><br>
<A NAME=135>Not as protector, steward, substitute,</A><br>
<A NAME=136>Or lowly factor for another's gain;</A><br>
<A NAME=137>But as successively from blood to blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Your right of birth, your empery, your own.</A><br>
<A NAME=139>For this, consorted with the citizens,</A><br>
<A NAME=140>Your very worshipful and loving friends,</A><br>
<A NAME=141>And by their vehement instigation,</A><br>
<A NAME=142>In this just suit come I to move your grace.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>I know not whether to depart in silence,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.</A><br>
<A NAME=145>Best fitteth my degree or your condition</A><br>
<A NAME=146>If not to answer, you might haply think</A><br>
<A NAME=147>Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded</A><br>
<A NAME=148>To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,</A><br>
<A NAME=149>Which fondly you would here impose on me;</A><br>
<A NAME=150>If to reprove you for this suit of yours,</A><br>
<A NAME=151>So season'd with your faithful love to me.</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.</A><br>
<A NAME=153>Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,</A><br>
<A NAME=154>And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,</A><br>
<A NAME=155>Definitively thus I answer you.</A><br>
<A NAME=156>Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert</A><br>
<A NAME=157>Unmeritable shuns your high request.</A><br>
<A NAME=158>First if all obstacles were cut away,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>And that my path were even to the crown,</A><br>
<A NAME=160>As my ripe revenue and due by birth</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,</A><br>
<A NAME=162>So mighty and so many my defects,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>As I had rather hide me from my greatness,</A><br>
<A NAME=164>Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,</A><br>
<A NAME=165>Than in my greatness covet to be hid,</A><br>
<A NAME=166>And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.</A><br>
<A NAME=167>But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,</A><br>
<A NAME=168>And much I need to help you, if need were;</A><br>
<A NAME=169>The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,</A><br>
<A NAME=170>Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Will well become the seat of majesty,</A><br>
<A NAME=172>And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.</A><br>
<A NAME=173>On him I lay what you would lay on me,</A><br>
<A NAME=174>The right and fortune of his happy stars;</A><br>
<A NAME=175>Which God defend that I should wring from him!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=176>My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;</A><br>
<A NAME=177>But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,</A><br>
<A NAME=178>All circumstances well considered.</A><br>
<A NAME=179>You say that Edward is your brother's son:</A><br>
<A NAME=180>So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;</A><br>
<A NAME=181>For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--</A><br>
<A NAME=182>Your mother lives a witness to that vow--</A><br>
<A NAME=183>And afterward by substitute betroth'd</A><br>
<A NAME=184>To Bona, sister to the King of France.</A><br>
<A NAME=185>These both put by a poor petitioner,</A><br>
<A NAME=186>A care-crazed mother of a many children,</A><br>
<A NAME=187>A beauty-waning and distressed widow,</A><br>
<A NAME=188>Even in the afternoon of her best days,</A><br>
<A NAME=189>Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,</A><br>
<A NAME=190>Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts</A><br>
<A NAME=191>To base declension and loathed bigamy</A><br>
<A NAME=192>By her, in his unlawful bed, he got</A><br>
<A NAME=193>This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.</A><br>
<A NAME=194>More bitterly could I expostulate,</A><br>
<A NAME=195>Save that, for reverence to some alive,</A><br>
<A NAME=196>I give a sparing limit to my tongue.</A><br>
<A NAME=197>Then, good my lord, take to your royal self</A><br>
<A NAME=198>This proffer'd benefit of dignity;</A><br>
<A NAME=199>If non to bless us and the land withal,</A><br>
<A NAME=200>Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry</A><br>
<A NAME=201>From the corruption of abusing times,</A><br>
<A NAME=202>Unto a lineal true-derived course.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>Lord Mayor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=203>Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=204>Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>CATESBY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=205>O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=206>Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?</A><br>
<A NAME=207>I am unfit for state and majesty;</A><br>
<A NAME=208>I do beseech you, take it not amiss;</A><br>
<A NAME=209>I cannot nor I will not yield to you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=210>If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,</A><br>
<A NAME=211>Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;</A><br>
<A NAME=212>As well we know your tenderness of heart</A><br>
<A NAME=213>And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,</A><br>
<A NAME=214>Which we have noted in you to your kin,</A><br>
<A NAME=215>And egally indeed to all estates,--</A><br>
<A NAME=216>Yet whether you accept our suit or no,</A><br>
<A NAME=217>Your brother's son shall never reign our king;</A><br>
<A NAME=218>But we will plant some other in the throne,</A><br>
<A NAME=219>To the disgrace and downfall of your house:</A><br>
<A NAME=220>And in this resolution here we leave you.--</A><br>
<A NAME=221>Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.</A><br>

<blockquote>
<A NAME=225>Would you enforce me to a world of care?</A><br>
