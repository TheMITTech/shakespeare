<H3>SCENE V. The Tower-walls.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour, marvellous ill-favoured</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,</A><br>
<A NAME=2>Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,</A><br>
<A NAME=3>And then begin again, and stop again,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;</A><br>
<A NAME=6>Speak and look back, and pry on every side,</A><br>
<A NAME=7>Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Are at my service, like enforced smiles;</A><br>
<A NAME=10>And both are ready in their offices,</A><br>
<A NAME=11>At any time, to grace my stratagems.</A><br>
<A NAME=12>But what, is Catesby gone?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>Lord mayor,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>Look to the drawbridge there!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=16>Hark! a drum.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>Catesby, o'erlook the walls.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>God and our innocency defend and guard us!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>LOVEL</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=22>Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.</A><br>
<A NAME=25>I took him for the plainest harmless creature</A><br>
<A NAME=26>That breathed upon this earth a Christian;</A><br>
<A NAME=27>Made him my book wherein my soul recorded</A><br>
<A NAME=28>The history of all her secret thoughts:</A><br>
<A NAME=29>So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>That, his apparent open guilt omitted,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>He lived from all attainder of suspect.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor</A><br>
<A NAME=34>That ever lived.</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Would you imagine, or almost believe,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Were't not that, by great preservation,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor</A><br>
<A NAME=38>This day had plotted, in the council-house</A><br>
<A NAME=39>To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>Lord Mayor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>What, had he so?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>What, think You we are Turks or infidels?</A><br>
<A NAME=42>Or that we would, against the form of law,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,</A><br>
<A NAME=44>But that the extreme peril of the case,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>The peace of England and our persons' safety,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Enforced us to this execution?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Lord Mayor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=47>Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;</A><br>
<A NAME=48>And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>To warn false traitors from the like attempts.</A><br>
<A NAME=50>I never look'd for better at his hands,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Yet had not we determined he should die,</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Until your lordship came to see his death;</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Which now the loving haste of these our friends,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:</A><br>
<A NAME=56>Because, my lord, we would have had you heard</A><br>
<A NAME=57>The traitor speak, and timorously confess</A><br>
<A NAME=58>The manner and the purpose of his treason;</A><br>
<A NAME=59>That you might well have signified the same</A><br>
<A NAME=60>Unto the citizens, who haply may</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>Lord Mayor</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>As well as I had seen and heard him speak</A><br>
<A NAME=64>And doubt you not, right noble princes both,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens</A><br>
<A NAME=66>With all your just proceedings in this cause.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>To avoid the carping censures of the world.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=69>But since you come too late of our intents,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Yet witness what you hear we did intend:</A><br>
<A NAME=71>And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit Lord Mayor</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=72>Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.</A><br>
<A NAME=73>The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:</A><br>
<A NAME=74>There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:</A><br>
<A NAME=76>Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,</A><br>
<A NAME=77>Only for saying he would make his son</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,</A><br>
<A NAME=79>Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.</A><br>
<A NAME=80>Moreover, urge his hateful luxury</A><br>
<A NAME=81>And bestial appetite in change of lust;</A><br>
<A NAME=82>Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,</A><br>
<A NAME=83>Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Without control, listed to make his prey.</A><br>
<A NAME=85>Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Tell them, when that my mother went with child</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York</A><br>
<A NAME=88>My princely father then had wars in France</A><br>
<A NAME=89>And, by just computation of the time,</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Found that the issue was not his begot;</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Which well appeared in his lineaments,</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Being nothing like the noble duke my father:</A><br>
<A NAME=93>But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=95>Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator</A><br>
<A NAME=96>As if the golden fee for which I plead</A><br>
<A NAME=97>Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;</A><br>
<A NAME=99>Where you shall find me well accompanied</A><br>
<A NAME=100>With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>BUCKINGHAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=101>I go: and towards three or four o'clock</A><br>
<A NAME=102>Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit BUCKINGHAM</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>GLOUCESTER</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;</A><br>
<p><i>To CATESBY</i></p>
<A NAME=104>Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both</A><br>
<A NAME=105>Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER</i></p>
<A NAME=106>Now will I in, to take some privy order,</A><br>
<A NAME=107>To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;</A><br>
<A NAME=108>And to give notice, that no manner of person</A><br>
<A NAME=109>At any time have recourse unto the princes.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
