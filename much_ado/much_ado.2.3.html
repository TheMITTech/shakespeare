<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter BENEDICK</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Boy!</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Boy</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Boy</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>Signior?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither</A><br>
<A NAME=4>to me in the orchard.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Boy</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>I am here already, sir.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit Boy</i></p>
<A NAME=7>I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much</A><br>
<A NAME=8>another man is a fool when he dedicates his</A><br>
<A NAME=9>behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at</A><br>
<A NAME=10>such shallow follies in others, become the argument</A><br>
<A NAME=11>of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man</A><br>
<A NAME=12>is Claudio. I have known when there was no music</A><br>
<A NAME=13>with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he</A><br>
<A NAME=14>rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known</A><br>
<A NAME=15>when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a</A><br>
<A NAME=16>good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,</A><br>
<A NAME=17>carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to</A><br>
<A NAME=18>speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man</A><br>
<A NAME=19>and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his</A><br>
<A NAME=20>words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many</A><br>
<A NAME=21>strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with</A><br>
<A NAME=22>these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not</A><br>
<A NAME=23>be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but</A><br>
<A NAME=24>I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster</A><br>
<A NAME=25>of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman</A><br>
<A NAME=26>is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am</A><br>
<A NAME=27>well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all</A><br>
<A NAME=28>graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in</A><br>
<A NAME=29>my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;</A><br>
<A NAME=31>fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not</A><br>
<A NAME=32>near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good</A><br>
<A NAME=33>discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall</A><br>
<A NAME=34>be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.</A><br>
<p><i>Withdraws</i></p>
<p><i>Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>Come, shall we hear this music?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>See you where Benedick hath hid himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>O, very well, my lord: the music ended,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BALTHASAR with Music</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=43>O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice</A><br>
<A NAME=44>To slander music any more than once.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=45>It is the witness still of excellency</A><br>
<A NAME=46>To put a strange face on his own perfection.</A><br>
<A NAME=47>I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=48>Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Since many a wooer doth commence his suit</A><br>
<A NAME=50>To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Yet will he swear he loves.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>Now, pray thee, come;</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Do it in notes.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=55>                  Note this before my notes;</A><br>
<A NAME=56>There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;</A><br>
<A NAME=58>Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.</A><br>
<p><i>Air</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it</A><br>
<A NAME=60>not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out</A><br>
<A NAME=61>of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when</A><br>
<A NAME=62>all's done.</A><br>
<p><i>The Song</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=63>     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,</A><br>
<A NAME=64>Men were deceivers ever,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>One foot in sea and one on shore,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>To one thing constant never:</A><br>
<A NAME=67>Then sigh not so, but let them go,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>And be you blithe and bonny,</A><br>
<A NAME=69>Converting all your sounds of woe</A><br>
<A NAME=70>Into Hey nonny, nonny.</A><br>
<A NAME=71>Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,</A><br>
<A NAME=72>Of dumps so dull and heavy;</A><br>
<A NAME=73>The fraud of men was ever so,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Since summer first was leafy:</A><br>
<A NAME=75>Then sigh not so,  & c.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>By my troth, a good song.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>And an ill singer, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,</A><br>
<A NAME=80>they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad</A><br>
<A NAME=81>voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the</A><br>
<A NAME=82>night-raven, come what plague could have come after</A><br>
<A NAME=83>it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,</A><br>
<A NAME=85>get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we</A><br>
<A NAME=86>would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>BALTHASAR</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=87>The best I can, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>Do so: farewell.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit BALTHASAR</i></p>
<A NAME=89>Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of</A><br>
<A NAME=90>to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with</A><br>
<A NAME=91>Signior Benedick?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did</A><br>
<A NAME=93>never think that lady would have loved any man.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=94>No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she</A><br>
<A NAME=95>should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in</A><br>
<A NAME=96>all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think</A><br>
<A NAME=99>of it but that she loves him with an enraged</A><br>
<A NAME=100>affection: it is past the infinite of thought.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=101>May be she doth but counterfeit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>Faith, like enough.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of</A><br>
<A NAME=104>passion came so near the life of passion as she</A><br>
<A NAME=105>discovers it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=106>Why, what effects of passion shows she?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard</A><br>
<A NAME=109>my daughter tell you how.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=110>She did, indeed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=111>How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I</A><br>
<A NAME=112>thought her spirit had been invincible against all</A><br>
<A NAME=113>assaults of affection.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially</A><br>
<A NAME=115>against Benedick.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>I should think this a gull, but that the</A><br>
<A NAME=117>white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,</A><br>
<A NAME=118>sure, hide himself in such reverence.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=119>He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=120>Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=121>No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=122>'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall</A><br>
<A NAME=123>I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him</A><br>
<A NAME=124>with scorn, write to him that I love him?'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech44><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=125>This says she now when she is beginning to write to</A><br>
<A NAME=126>him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and</A><br>
<A NAME=127>there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a</A><br>
<A NAME=128>sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=129>Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a</A><br>
<A NAME=130>pretty jest your daughter told us of.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech46><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=131>O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she</A><br>
<A NAME=132>found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech47><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=133>That.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=134>O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;</A><br>
<A NAME=135>railed at herself, that she should be so immodest</A><br>
<A NAME=136>to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I</A><br>
<A NAME=137>measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I</A><br>
<A NAME=138>should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I</A><br>
<A NAME=139>love him, I should.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,</A><br>
<A NAME=141>beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O</A><br>
<A NAME=142>sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech50><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the</A><br>
<A NAME=144>ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter</A><br>
<A NAME=145>is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage</A><br>
<A NAME=146>to herself: it is very true.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech51><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=147>It were good that Benedick knew of it by some</A><br>
<A NAME=148>other, if she will not discover it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=149>To what end? He would make but a sport of it and</A><br>
<A NAME=150>torment the poor lady worse.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech53><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=151>An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an</A><br>
<A NAME=152>excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,</A><br>
<A NAME=153>she is virtuous.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech54><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=154>And she is exceeding wise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech55><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=155>In every thing but in loving Benedick.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech56><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender</A><br>
<A NAME=157>a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath</A><br>
<A NAME=158>the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just</A><br>
<A NAME=159>cause, being her uncle and her guardian.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=160>I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would</A><br>
<A NAME=161>have daffed all other respects and made her half</A><br>
<A NAME=162>myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear</A><br>
<A NAME=163>what a' will say.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech58><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=164>Were it good, think you?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech59><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=165>Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she</A><br>
<A NAME=166>will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere</A><br>
<A NAME=167>she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo</A><br>
<A NAME=168>her, rather than she will bate one breath of her</A><br>
<A NAME=169>accustomed crossness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech60><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=170>She doth well: if she should make tender of her</A><br>
<A NAME=171>love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the</A><br>
<A NAME=172>man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech61><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=173>He is a very proper man.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech62><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=174>He hath indeed a good outward happiness.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech63><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=175>Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech64><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=176>He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech65><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=177>And I take him to be valiant.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech66><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=178>As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of</A><br>
<A NAME=179>quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he</A><br>
<A NAME=180>avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes</A><br>
<A NAME=181>them with a most Christian-like fear.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech67><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=182>If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:</A><br>
<A NAME=183>if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a</A><br>
<A NAME=184>quarrel with fear and trembling.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech68><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=185>And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,</A><br>
<A NAME=186>howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests</A><br>
<A NAME=187>he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall</A><br>
<A NAME=188>we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech69><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=189>Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with</A><br>
<A NAME=190>good counsel.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech70><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=191>Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech71><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=192>Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:</A><br>
<A NAME=193>let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I</A><br>
<A NAME=194>could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see</A><br>
<A NAME=195>how much he is unworthy so good a lady.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech72><b>LEONATO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=196>My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech73><b>CLAUDIO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=197>If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never</A><br>
<A NAME=198>trust my expectation.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech74><b>DON PEDRO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=199>Let there be the same net spread for her; and that</A><br>
<A NAME=200>must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The</A><br>
<A NAME=201>sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of</A><br>
<A NAME=202>another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the</A><br>
<A NAME=203>scene that I would see, which will be merely a</A><br>
<A NAME=204>dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech75><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=205>[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the</A><br>
<A NAME=206>conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of</A><br>
<A NAME=207>this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it</A><br>
<A NAME=208>seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!</A><br>
<A NAME=209>why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:</A><br>
<A NAME=210>they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive</A><br>
<A NAME=211>the love come from her; they say too that she will</A><br>
<A NAME=212>rather die than give any sign of affection. I did</A><br>
<A NAME=213>never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy</A><br>
<A NAME=214>are they that hear their detractions and can put</A><br>
<A NAME=215>them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a</A><br>
<A NAME=216>truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis</A><br>
<A NAME=217>so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving</A><br>
<A NAME=218>me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor</A><br>
<A NAME=219>no great argument of her folly, for I will be</A><br>
<A NAME=220>horribly in love with her. I may chance have some</A><br>
<A NAME=221>odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,</A><br>
<A NAME=222>because I have railed so long against marriage: but</A><br>
<A NAME=223>doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat</A><br>
<A NAME=224>in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.</A><br>
<A NAME=225>Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of</A><br>
<A NAME=226>the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?</A><br>
<A NAME=227>No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would</A><br>
<A NAME=228>die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I</A><br>
<A NAME=229>were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!</A><br>
<A NAME=230>she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in</A><br>
<A NAME=231>her.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BEATRICE</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech76><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=232>Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.</A><br>

<A NAME=speech77><b>BENEDICK</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=233>Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech78><b>BEATRICE</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=234>I took no more pains for those thanks than you take</A><br>

<A NAME=238>Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's</A><br>
<A NAME=239>point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,</A><br>

<A NAME=241>Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in</A><br>
<A NAME=242>to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took</A><br>
<A NAME=243>no more pains for those thanks than you took pains</A><br>
<A NAME=244>to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains</A><br>
<A NAME=245>that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do</A><br>
<A NAME=246>not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not</A><br>
<A NAME=247>love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.</A><br>
