<h3>SCENE I. Before an alehouse on a heath.</H3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter Hostess and SLY</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>I'll pheeze you, in faith.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>A pair of stocks, you rogue!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in</A><br>
<A NAME=4>the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold</A><br>
<A NAME=8>bed, and warm thee.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Hostess</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=9>I know my remedy; I must go fetch the</A><br>
<A NAME=10>third--borough.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>SLY</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him</A><br>
<A NAME=12>by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,</A><br>
<A NAME=13>and kindly.</A><br>
<p><i>Falls asleep</i></p>
<p><i>Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=14>Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:</A><br>
<A NAME=15>Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;</A><br>
<A NAME=16>And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.</A><br>
<A NAME=17>Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good</A><br>
<A NAME=18>At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?</A><br>
<A NAME=19>I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;</A><br>
<A NAME=21>He cried upon it at the merest loss</A><br>
<A NAME=22>And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Trust me, I take him for the better dog.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=24>Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>I would esteem him worth a dozen such.</A><br>
<A NAME=26>But sup them well and look unto them all:</A><br>
<A NAME=27>To-morrow I intend to hunt again.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>I will, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>Second Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,</A><br>
<A NAME=31>This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=32>O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.</A><br>
<A NAME=35>What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>A most delicious banquet by his bed,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>And brave attendants near him when he wakes,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>Would not the beggar then forget himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Second Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>It would seem strange unto him when he waked.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.</A><br>
<A NAME=43>Then take him up and manage well the jest:</A><br>
<A NAME=44>Carry him gently to my fairest chamber</A><br>
<A NAME=45>And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters</A><br>
<A NAME=47>And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Procure me music ready when he wakes,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;</A><br>
<A NAME=50>And if he chance to speak, be ready straight</A><br>
<A NAME=51>And with a low submissive reverence</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Say 'What is it your honour will command?'</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Let one attend him with a silver basin</A><br>
<A NAME=54>Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,</A><br>
<A NAME=56>And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'</A><br>
<A NAME=57>Some one be ready with a costly suit</A><br>
<A NAME=58>And ask him what apparel he will wear;</A><br>
<A NAME=59>Another tell him of his hounds and horse,</A><br>
<A NAME=60>And that his lady mourns at his disease:</A><br>
<A NAME=61>Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;</A><br>
<A NAME=62>And when he says he is, say that he dreams,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>For he is nothing but a mighty lord.</A><br>
<A NAME=64>This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:</A><br>
<A NAME=65>It will be pastime passing excellent,</A><br>
<A NAME=66>If it be husbanded with modesty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>First Huntsman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>As he shall think by our true diligence</A><br>
<A NAME=69>He is no less than what we say he is.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=70>Take him up gently and to bed with him;</A><br>
<A NAME=71>And each one to his office when he wakes.</A><br>
<p><i>Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds</i></p>
<A NAME=72>Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:</A><br>
<p><i>Exit Servingman</i></p>
<A NAME=73>Belike, some noble gentleman that means,</A><br>
<A NAME=74>Travelling some journey, to repose him here.</A><br>
<p><i>Re-enter Servingman</i></p>
<A NAME=75>How now! who is it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>An't please your honour, players</A><br>
<A NAME=77>That offer service to your lordship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>Bid them come near.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Players</i></p>
<A NAME=79>Now, fellows, you are welcome.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>Players</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>We thank your honour.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Do you intend to stay with me tonight?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=82>So please your lordship to accept our duty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>With all my heart. This fellow I remember,</A><br>
<A NAME=84>Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:</A><br>
<A NAME=85>'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:</A><br>
<A NAME=86>I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part</A><br>
<A NAME=87>Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=89>'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.</A><br>
<A NAME=90>Well, you are come to me in a happy time;</A><br>
<A NAME=91>The rather for I have some sport in hand</A><br>
<A NAME=92>Wherein your cunning can assist me much.</A><br>
<A NAME=93>There is a lord will hear you play to-night:</A><br>
<A NAME=94>But I am doubtful of your modesties;</A><br>
<A NAME=95>Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--</A><br>
<A NAME=96>For yet his honour never heard a play--</A><br>
<A NAME=97>You break into some merry passion</A><br>
<A NAME=98>And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,</A><br>
<A NAME=99>If you should smile he grows impatient.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>A Player</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=101>Were he the veriest antic in the world.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=102>Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,</A><br>
<A NAME=103>And give them friendly welcome every one:</A><br>
<A NAME=104>Let them want nothing that my house affords.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit one with the Players</i></p>
<A NAME=105>Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,</A><br>
<A NAME=106>And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:</A><br>
<A NAME=107>That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;</A><br>
<A NAME=108>And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.</A><br>
<A NAME=109>Tell him from me, as he will win my love,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>He bear himself with honourable action,</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Such as he hath observed in noble ladies</A><br>
<A NAME=112>Unto their lords, by them accomplished:</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Such duty to the drunkard let him do</A><br>
<A NAME=114>With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,</A><br>
<A NAME=115>And say 'What is't your honour will command,</A><br>
<A NAME=116>Wherein your lady and your humble wife</A><br>
<A NAME=117>May show her duty and make known her love?'</A><br>
<A NAME=118>And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>And with declining head into his bosom,</A><br>
<A NAME=120>Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd</A><br>
<A NAME=121>To see her noble lord restored to health,</A><br>
<A NAME=122>Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him</A><br>
<A NAME=123>No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:</A><br>
<A NAME=124>And if the boy have not a woman's gift</A><br>
<A NAME=125>To rain a shower of commanded tears,</A><br>
<A NAME=126>An onion will do well for such a shift,</A><br>
<A NAME=127>Which in a napkin being close convey'd</A><br>
<A NAME=128>Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.</A><br>
<A NAME=129>See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:</A><br>
<A NAME=130>Anon I'll give thee more instructions.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit a Servingman</i></p>
<A NAME=131>I know the boy will well usurp the grace,</A><br>
<A NAME=132>Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:</A><br>
<A NAME=133>I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,</A><br>
<A NAME=134>And how my men will stay themselves from laughter</A><br>
<A NAME=135>When they do homage to this simple peasant.</A><br>
<A NAME=136>I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence</A><br>
<A NAME=137>May well abate the over-merry spleen</A><br>
<A NAME=138>Which otherwise would grow into extremes.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
