<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>I will, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,</A><br>
<A NAME=4>Before you visit him, to make inquire</A><br>
<A NAME=5>Of his behavior.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=6>                  My lord, I did intend it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,</A><br>
<A NAME=8>Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;</A><br>
<A NAME=9>And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,</A><br>
<A NAME=10>What company, at what expense; and finding</A><br>
<A NAME=11>By this encompassment and drift of question</A><br>
<A NAME=12>That they do know my son, come you more nearer</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Than your particular demands will touch it:</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;</A><br>
<A NAME=15>As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,</A><br>
<A NAME=16>And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>Ay, very well, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:</A><br>
<A NAME=19>But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;</A><br>
<A NAME=20>Addicted so and so:' and there put on him</A><br>
<A NAME=21>What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank</A><br>
<A NAME=22>As may dishonour him; take heed of that;</A><br>
<A NAME=23>But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips</A><br>
<A NAME=24>As are companions noted and most known</A><br>
<A NAME=25>To youth and liberty.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=26>As gaming, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=27>Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Drabbing: you may go so far.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>My lord, that would dishonour him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge</A><br>
<A NAME=31>You must not put another scandal on him,</A><br>
<A NAME=32>That he is open to incontinency;</A><br>
<A NAME=33>That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly</A><br>
<A NAME=34>That they may seem the taints of liberty,</A><br>
<A NAME=35>The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>A savageness in unreclaimed blood,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>Of general assault.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>But, my good lord,--</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=39>Wherefore should you do this?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>Ay, my lord,</A><br>
<A NAME=41>I would know that.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;</A><br>
<A NAME=43>And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:</A><br>
<A NAME=44>You laying these slight sullies on my son,</A><br>
<A NAME=45>As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>Your party in converse, him you would sound,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes</A><br>
<A NAME=48>The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured</A><br>
<A NAME=49>He closes with you in this consequence;</A><br>
<A NAME=50>'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'</A><br>
<A NAME=51>According to the phrase or the addition</A><br>
<A NAME=52>Of man and country.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=53>Very good, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=54>And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I</A><br>
<A NAME=55>about to say? By the mass, I was about to say</A><br>
<A NAME=56>something: where did I leave?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'</A><br>
<A NAME=58>and 'gentleman.'</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;</A><br>
<A NAME=60>He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;</A><br>
<A NAME=61>I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,</A><br>
<A NAME=63>There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;</A><br>
<A NAME=64>There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,</A><br>
<A NAME=65>'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'</A><br>
<A NAME=66>Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.</A><br>
<A NAME=67>See you now;</A><br>
<A NAME=68>Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:</A><br>
<A NAME=69>And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,</A><br>
<A NAME=70>With windlasses and with assays of bias,</A><br>
<A NAME=71>By indirections find directions out:</A><br>
<A NAME=72>So by my former lecture and advice,</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=74>My lord, I have.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>                  God be wi' you; fare you well.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=76>Good my lord!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>Observe his inclination in yourself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=78>I shall, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>And let him ply his music.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>REYNALDO</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>Well, my lord.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>Farewell!</A><br>
<p><i>Exit REYNALDO</i></p>
<p><i>Enter OPHELIA</i></p>
<A NAME=82>How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=83>O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>With what, i' the name of God?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,</A><br>
<A NAME=86>Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;</A><br>
<A NAME=87>No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=88>Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;</A><br>
<A NAME=89>Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;</A><br>
<A NAME=90>And with a look so piteous in purport</A><br>
<A NAME=91>As if he had been loosed out of hell</A><br>
<A NAME=92>To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>Mad for thy love?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=94>                  My lord, I do not know;</A><br>
<A NAME=95>But truly, I do fear it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>What said he?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=97>He took me by the wrist and held me hard;</A><br>
<A NAME=98>Then goes he to the length of all his arm;</A><br>
<A NAME=99>And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,</A><br>
<A NAME=100>He falls to such perusal of my face</A><br>
<A NAME=101>As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;</A><br>
<A NAME=102>At last, a little shaking of mine arm</A><br>
<A NAME=103>And thrice his head thus waving up and down,</A><br>
<A NAME=104>He raised a sigh so piteous and profound</A><br>
<A NAME=105>As it did seem to shatter all his bulk</A><br>
<A NAME=106>And end his being: that done, he lets me go:</A><br>
<A NAME=107>And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,</A><br>
<A NAME=108>He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;</A><br>
<A NAME=109>For out o' doors he went without their helps,</A><br>
<A NAME=110>And, to the last, bended their light on me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=111>Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.</A><br>
<A NAME=112>This is the very ecstasy of love,</A><br>
<A NAME=113>Whose violent property fordoes itself</A><br>
<A NAME=114>And leads the will to desperate undertakings</A><br>
<A NAME=115>As oft as any passion under heaven</A><br>
<A NAME=116>That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.</A><br>
<A NAME=117>What, have you given him any hard words of late?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>OPHELIA</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>No, my good lord, but, as you did command,</A><br>
<A NAME=119>I did repel his fetters and denied</A><br>
<A NAME=120>His access to me.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>LORD POLONIUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=121>                  That hath made him mad.</A><br>
<A NAME=122>I am sorry that with better heed and judgment</A><br>
<A NAME=123>I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!</A><br>
<A NAME=125>By heaven, it is as proper to our age</A><br>
<A NAME=126>To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions</A><br>
<A NAME=127>As it is common for the younger sort</A><br>
<A NAME=128>To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:</A><br>
<A NAME=129>This must be known; which, being kept close, might</A><br>
<A NAME=130>move</A><br>
<A NAME=131>More grief to hide than hate to utter love.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
