<H3>SCENE III. The Florentine camp.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>You have not given him his mother's letter?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>I have delivered it an hour since: there is</A><br>
<A NAME=3>something in't that stings his nature; for on the</A><br>
<A NAME=4>reading it he changed almost into another man.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=5>He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking</A><br>
<A NAME=6>off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>Especially he hath incurred the everlasting</A><br>
<A NAME=8>displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his</A><br>
<A NAME=9>bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a</A><br>
<A NAME=10>thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the</A><br>
<A NAME=12>grave of it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=13>He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he</A><br>
<A NAME=15>fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath</A><br>
<A NAME=16>given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself</A><br>
<A NAME=17>made in the unchaste composition.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=18>Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,</A><br>
<A NAME=19>what things are we!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=20>Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course</A><br>
<A NAME=21>of all treasons, we still see them reveal</A><br>
<A NAME=22>themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,</A><br>
<A NAME=23>so he that in this action contrives against his own</A><br>
<A NAME=24>nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=25>Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of</A><br>
<A NAME=26>our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his</A><br>
<A NAME=27>company to-night?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=28>Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=29>That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see</A><br>
<A NAME=30>his company anatomized, that he might take a measure</A><br>
<A NAME=31>of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had</A><br>
<A NAME=32>set this counterfeit.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=33>We will not meddle with him till he come; for his</A><br>
<A NAME=34>presence must be the whip of the other.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=35>In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=36>I hear there is an overture of peace.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=37>Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=38>What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel</A><br>
<A NAME=39>higher, or return again into France?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=40>I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether</A><br>
<A NAME=41>of his council.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal</A><br>
<A NAME=43>of his act.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=44>Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his</A><br>
<A NAME=45>house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques</A><br>
<A NAME=46>le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere</A><br>
<A NAME=47>sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the</A><br>
<A NAME=48>tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her</A><br>
<A NAME=49>grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and</A><br>
<A NAME=50>now she sings in heaven.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=51>How is this justified?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=52>The stronger part of it by her own letters, which</A><br>
<A NAME=53>makes her story true, even to the point of her</A><br>
<A NAME=54>death: her death itself, which could not be her</A><br>
<A NAME=55>office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by</A><br>
<A NAME=56>the rector of the place.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=57>Hath the count all this intelligence?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=58>Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from</A><br>
<A NAME=59>point, so to the full arming of the verity.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=60>I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=62>And how mightily some other times we drown our gain</A><br>
<A NAME=63>in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath</A><br>
<A NAME=64>here acquired for him shall at home be encountered</A><br>
<A NAME=65>with a shame as ample.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=66>The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and</A><br>
<A NAME=67>ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our</A><br>
<A NAME=68>faults whipped them not; and our crimes would</A><br>
<A NAME=69>despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a Messenger</i></p>
<A NAME=70>How now! where's your master?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>Servant</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=71>He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath</A><br>
<A NAME=72>taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next</A><br>
<A NAME=73>morning for France. The duke hath offered him</A><br>
<A NAME=74>letters of commendations to the king.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=75>They shall be no more than needful there, if they</A><br>
<A NAME=76>were more than they can commend.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=77>They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.</A><br>
<A NAME=78>Here's his lordship now.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter BERTRAM</i></p>
<A NAME=79>How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=80>I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a</A><br>
<A NAME=81>month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:</A><br>
<A NAME=82>I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his</A><br>
<A NAME=83>nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my</A><br>
<A NAME=84>lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;</A><br>
<A NAME=85>and between these main parcels of dispatch effected</A><br>
<A NAME=86>many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but</A><br>
<A NAME=87>that I have not ended yet.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>If the business be of any difficulty, and this</A><br>
<A NAME=89>morning your departure hence, it requires haste of</A><br>
<A NAME=90>your lordship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=91>I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to</A><br>
<A NAME=92>hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this</A><br>
<A NAME=93>dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived</A><br>
<A NAME=95>me, like a double-meaning prophesier.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=96>Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,</A><br>
<A NAME=97>poor gallant knave.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=98>No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping</A><br>
<A NAME=99>his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=100>I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry</A><br>
<A NAME=101>him. But to answer you as you would be understood;</A><br>
<A NAME=102>he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he</A><br>
<A NAME=103>hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes</A><br>
<A NAME=104>to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to</A><br>
<A NAME=105>this very instant disaster of his setting i' the</A><br>
<A NAME=106>stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=107>Nothing of me, has a'?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>Second Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his</A><br>
<A NAME=109>face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you</A><br>
<A NAME=110>are, you must have the patience to hear it.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech39><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=111>A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of</A><br>
<A NAME=112>me: hush, hush!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech40><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech41><b>First Soldier</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>He calls for the tortures: what will you say</A><br>
<A NAME=115>without 'em?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech42><b>PAROLLES</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>I will confess what I know without constraint: if</A><br>
<A NAME=117>ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech43><b>First Soldier</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=118>Bosko chimurcho.</A><br>

<blockquote>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech45><b>First Soldier</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=120>You are a merciful general. Our general bids you</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech48><b>PAROLLES</b></a>

<A NAME=125>Five or six thousand; but very weak and</A><br>
<A NAME=126>unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and</A><br>
<A NAME=127>the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation</A><br>
<A NAME=128>and credit and as I hope to live.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech49><b>First Soldier</b></a>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech52><b>First Lord</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=132>You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur</A><br>

</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech57><b>BERTRAM</b></a>
<blockquote>
