<H3>SCENE II. Before LEONTES' palace.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=2>I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old</A><br>
<A NAME=3>shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:</A><br>
<A NAME=4>whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all</A><br>
<A NAME=5>commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I</A><br>
<A NAME=6>heard the shepherd say, he found the child.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=7>I would most gladly know the issue of it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>I make a broken delivery of the business; but the</A><br>
<A NAME=9>changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were</A><br>
<A NAME=10>very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with</A><br>
<A NAME=11>staring on one another, to tear the cases of their</A><br>
<A NAME=12>eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language</A><br>
<A NAME=13>in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard</A><br>
<A NAME=14>of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable</A><br>
<A NAME=15>passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest</A><br>
<A NAME=16>beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not</A><br>
<A NAME=17>say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the</A><br>
<A NAME=18>extremity of the one, it must needs be.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter another Gentleman</i></p>
<A NAME=19>Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.</A><br>
<A NAME=20>The news, Rogero?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=21>Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the</A><br>
<A NAME=22>king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is</A><br>
<A NAME=23>broken out within this hour that ballad-makers</A><br>
<A NAME=24>cannot be able to express it.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter a third Gentleman</i></p>
<A NAME=25>Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can</A><br>
<A NAME=26>deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news</A><br>
<A NAME=27>which is called true is so like an old tale, that</A><br>
<A NAME=28>the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king</A><br>
<A NAME=29>found his heir?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=30>Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by</A><br>
<A NAME=31>circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you</A><br>
<A NAME=32>see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle</A><br>
<A NAME=33>of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>the letters of Antigonus found with it which they</A><br>
<A NAME=35>know to be his character, the majesty of the</A><br>
<A NAME=36>creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection</A><br>
<A NAME=37>of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,</A><br>
<A NAME=38>and many other evidences proclaim her with all</A><br>
<A NAME=39>certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see</A><br>
<A NAME=40>the meeting of the two kings?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=41>No.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=42>Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one</A><br>
<A NAME=44>joy crown another, so and in such manner that it</A><br>
<A NAME=45>seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their</A><br>
<A NAME=46>joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,</A><br>
<A NAME=47>holding up of hands, with countenances of such</A><br>
<A NAME=48>distraction that they were to be known by garment,</A><br>
<A NAME=49>not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of</A><br>
<A NAME=50>himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that</A><br>
<A NAME=51>joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,</A><br>
<A NAME=52>thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then</A><br>
<A NAME=53>embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his</A><br>
<A NAME=54>daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old</A><br>
<A NAME=55>shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten</A><br>
<A NAME=56>conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such</A><br>
<A NAME=57>another encounter, which lames report to follow it</A><br>
<A NAME=58>and undoes description to do it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=59>What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried</A><br>
<A NAME=60>hence the child?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=61>Like an old tale still, which will have matter to</A><br>
<A NAME=62>rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear</A><br>
<A NAME=63>open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this</A><br>
<A NAME=64>avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his</A><br>
<A NAME=65>innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a</A><br>
<A NAME=66>handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=67>What became of his bark and his followers?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=68>Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and</A><br>
<A NAME=69>in the view of the shepherd: so that all the</A><br>
<A NAME=70>instruments which aided to expose the child were</A><br>
<A NAME=71>even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble</A><br>
<A NAME=72>combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in</A><br>
<A NAME=73>Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of</A><br>
<A NAME=74>her husband, another elevated that the oracle was</A><br>
<A NAME=75>fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,</A><br>
<A NAME=76>and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin</A><br>
<A NAME=77>her to her heart that she might no more be in danger</A><br>
<A NAME=78>of losing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=79>The dignity of this act was worth the audience of</A><br>
<A NAME=80>kings and princes; for by such was it acted.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=81>One of the prettiest touches of all and that which</A><br>
<A NAME=82>angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not</A><br>
<A NAME=83>the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's</A><br>
<A NAME=84>death, with the manner how she came to't bravely</A><br>
<A NAME=85>confessed and lamented by the king, how</A><br>
<A NAME=86>attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one</A><br>
<A NAME=87>sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'</A><br>
<A NAME=88>I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my</A><br>
<A NAME=89>heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed</A><br>
<A NAME=90>colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world</A><br>
<A NAME=91>could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>Are they returned to the court?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Third Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many</A><br>
<A NAME=95>years in doing and now newly performed by that rare</A><br>
<A NAME=96>Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself</A><br>
<A NAME=97>eternity and could put breath into his work, would</A><br>
<A NAME=98>beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her</A><br>
<A NAME=99>ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that</A><br>
<A NAME=100>they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of</A><br>
<A NAME=101>answer: thither with all greediness of affection</A><br>
<A NAME=102>are they gone, and there they intend to sup.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Second Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=103>I thought she had some great matter there in hand;</A><br>
<A NAME=104>for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever</A><br>
<A NAME=105>since the death of Hermione, visited that removed</A><br>
<A NAME=106>house. Shall we thither and with our company piece</A><br>
<A NAME=107>the rejoicing?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>First Gentleman</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?</A><br>
<A NAME=109>every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:</A><br>
<A NAME=110>our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.</A><br>
<A NAME=111>Let's along.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt Gentlemen</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=112>Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,</A><br>
<A NAME=113>would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old</A><br>
<A NAME=114>man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard</A><br>
<A NAME=115>them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he</A><br>
<A NAME=116>at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>so he then took her to be, who began to be much</A><br>
<A NAME=118>sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of</A><br>
<A NAME=119>weather continuing, this mystery remained</A><br>
<A NAME=120>undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I</A><br>
<A NAME=121>been the finder out of this secret, it would not</A><br>
<A NAME=122>have relished among my other discredits.</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Shepherd and Clown</i></p>
<A NAME=123>Here come those I have done good to against my will,</A><br>
<A NAME=124>and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=125>Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and</A><br>
<A NAME=126>daughters will be all gentlemen born.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=127>You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me</A><br>
<A NAME=128>this other day, because I was no gentleman born.</A><br>
<A NAME=129>See you these clothes? say you see them not and</A><br>
<A NAME=130>think me still no gentleman born: you were best say</A><br>
<A NAME=131>these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the</A><br>
<A NAME=132>lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=133>I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=134>Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=135>And so have I, boy.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=136>So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my</A><br>
<A NAME=137>father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and</A><br>
<A NAME=138>called me brother; and then the two kings called my</A><br>
<A NAME=139>father brother; and then the prince my brother and</A><br>
<A NAME=140>the princess my sister called my father father; and</A><br>
<A NAME=141>so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like</A><br>
<A NAME=142>tears that ever we shed.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech26><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=143>We may live, son, to shed many more.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech27><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=144>Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so</A><br>
<A NAME=145>preposterous estate as we are.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech28><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=146>I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the</A><br>
<A NAME=147>faults I have committed to your worship and to give</A><br>
<A NAME=148>me your good report to the prince my master.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech29><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=149>Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are</A><br>
<A NAME=150>gentlemen.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech30><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=151>Thou wilt amend thy life?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech31><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=152>Ay, an it like your good worship.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech32><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=153>Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou</A><br>
<A NAME=154>art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech33><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=155>You may say it, but not swear it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech34><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=156>Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and</A><br>
<A NAME=157>franklins say it, I'll swear it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech35><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=158>How if it be false, son?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech36><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=159>If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear</A><br>
<A NAME=160>it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to</A><br>
<A NAME=161>the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and</A><br>
<A NAME=162>that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no</A><br>
<A NAME=163>tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be</A><br>
<A NAME=164>drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst</A><br>
<A NAME=165>be a tall fellow of thy hands.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech37><b>AUTOLYCUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=166>I will prove so, sir, to my power.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech38><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=167>Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not</A><br>
<A NAME=168>wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not</A><br>
<A NAME=169>being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings</A><br>
<A NAME=170>and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the</A><br>
<A NAME=171>queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy</A><br>
<A NAME=172>good masters.</A><br>
