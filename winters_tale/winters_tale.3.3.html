<H3>SCENE III. Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.</h3>

<p><blockquote>
<i>Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner</i>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech1><b>ANTIGONUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=1>Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon</A><br>
<A NAME=2>The deserts of Bohemia?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech2><b>Mariner</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=3>Ay, my lord: and fear</A><br>
<A NAME=4>We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly</A><br>
<A NAME=5>And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,</A><br>
<A NAME=6>The heavens with that we have in hand are angry</A><br>
<A NAME=7>And frown upon 's.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech3><b>ANTIGONUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=8>Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;</A><br>
<A NAME=9>Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before</A><br>
<A NAME=10>I call upon thee.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech4><b>Mariner</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=11>Make your best haste, and go not</A><br>
<A NAME=12>Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;</A><br>
<A NAME=13>Besides, this place is famous for the creatures</A><br>
<A NAME=14>Of prey that keep upon't.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech5><b>ANTIGONUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=15>Go thou away:</A><br>
<A NAME=16>I'll follow instantly.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech6><b>Mariner</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=17>I am glad at heart</A><br>
<A NAME=18>To be so rid o' the business.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech7><b>ANTIGONUS</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=19>Come, poor babe:</A><br>
<A NAME=20>I have heard, but not believed,</A><br>
<A NAME=21>the spirits o' the dead</A><br>
<A NAME=22>May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother</A><br>
<A NAME=23>Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream</A><br>
<A NAME=24>So like a waking. To me comes a creature,</A><br>
<A NAME=25>Sometimes her head on one side, some another;</A><br>
<A NAME=26>I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,</A><br>
<A NAME=27>So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,</A><br>
<A NAME=28>Like very sanctity, she did approach</A><br>
<A NAME=29>My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,</A><br>
<A NAME=30>And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes</A><br>
<A NAME=31>Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon</A><br>
<A NAME=32>Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,</A><br>
<A NAME=33>Since fate, against thy better disposition,</A><br>
<A NAME=34>Hath made thy person for the thrower-out</A><br>
<A NAME=35>Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,</A><br>
<A NAME=36>Places remote enough are in Bohemia,</A><br>
<A NAME=37>There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe</A><br>
<A NAME=38>Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,</A><br>
<A NAME=39>I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business</A><br>
<A NAME=40>Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see</A><br>
<A NAME=41>Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks</A><br>
<A NAME=42>She melted into air. Affrighted much,</A><br>
<A NAME=43>I did in time collect myself and thought</A><br>
<A NAME=44>This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:</A><br>
<A NAME=45>Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,</A><br>
<A NAME=46>I will be squared by this. I do believe</A><br>
<A NAME=47>Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that</A><br>
<A NAME=48>Apollo would, this being indeed the issue</A><br>
<A NAME=49>Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,</A><br>
<A NAME=50>Either for life or death, upon the earth</A><br>
<A NAME=51>Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!</A><br>
<A NAME=52>There lie, and there thy character: there these;</A><br>
<A NAME=53>Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,</A><br>
<A NAME=54>And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,</A><br>
<A NAME=55>That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed</A><br>
<A NAME=56>To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,</A><br>
<A NAME=57>But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I</A><br>
<A NAME=58>To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!</A><br>
<A NAME=59>The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have</A><br>
<A NAME=60>A lullaby too rough: I never saw</A><br>
<A NAME=61>The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!</A><br>
<A NAME=62>Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:</A><br>
<A NAME=63>I am gone for ever.</A><br>
<p><i>Exit, pursued by a bear</i></p>
<p><i>Enter a Shepherd</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech8><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=64>I would there were no age between sixteen and</A><br>
<A NAME=65>three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the</A><br>
<A NAME=66>rest; for there is nothing in the between but</A><br>
<A NAME=67>getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,</A><br>
<A NAME=68>stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but</A><br>
<A NAME=69>these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty</A><br>
<A NAME=70>hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my</A><br>
<A NAME=71>best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find</A><br>
<A NAME=72>than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by</A><br>
<A NAME=73>the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy</A><br>
<A NAME=74>will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very</A><br>
<A NAME=75>pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A</A><br>
<A NAME=76>pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:</A><br>
<A NAME=77>though I am not bookish, yet I can read</A><br>
<A NAME=78>waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been</A><br>
<A NAME=79>some stair-work, some trunk-work, some</A><br>
<A NAME=80>behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this</A><br>
<A NAME=81>than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for</A><br>
<A NAME=82>pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed</A><br>
<A NAME=83>but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Clown</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech9><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=84>Hilloa, loa!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech10><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=85>What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk</A><br>
<A NAME=86>on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What</A><br>
<A NAME=87>ailest thou, man?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech11><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=88>I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!</A><br>
<A NAME=89>but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the</A><br>
<A NAME=90>sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust</A><br>
<A NAME=91>a bodkin's point.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech12><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=92>Why, boy, how is it?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech13><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=93>I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,</A><br>
<A NAME=94>how it takes up the shore! but that's not the</A><br>
<A NAME=95>point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!</A><br>
<A NAME=96>sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the</A><br>
<A NAME=97>ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon</A><br>
<A NAME=98>swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a</A><br>
<A NAME=99>cork into a hogshead. And then for the</A><br>
<A NAME=100>land-service, to see how the bear tore out his</A><br>
<A NAME=101>shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said</A><br>
<A NAME=102>his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an</A><br>
<A NAME=103>end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned</A><br>
<A NAME=104>it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the</A><br>
<A NAME=105>sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared</A><br>
<A NAME=106>and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than</A><br>
<A NAME=107>the sea or weather.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech14><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=108>Name of mercy, when was this, boy?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech15><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=109>Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these</A><br>
<A NAME=110>sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor</A><br>
<A NAME=111>the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it</A><br>
<A NAME=112>now.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech16><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=113>Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech17><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=114>I would you had been by the ship side, to have</A><br>
<A NAME=115>helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech18><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=116>Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,</A><br>
<A NAME=117>boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things</A><br>
<A NAME=118>dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for</A><br>
<A NAME=119>thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's</A><br>
<A NAME=120>child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;</A><br>
<A NAME=121>open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be</A><br>
<A NAME=122>rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:</A><br>
<A NAME=123>open't. What's within, boy?</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech19><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=124>You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth</A><br>
<A NAME=125>are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech20><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=126>This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up</A><br>
<A NAME=127>with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.</A><br>
<A NAME=128>We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires</A><br>
<A NAME=129>nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good</A><br>
<A NAME=130>boy, the next way home.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech21><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=131>Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see</A><br>
<A NAME=132>if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much</A><br>
<A NAME=133>he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they</A><br>
<A NAME=134>are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury</A><br>
<A NAME=135>it.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech22><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=136>That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that</A><br>
<A NAME=137>which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the</A><br>
<A NAME=138>sight of him.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech23><b>Clown</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=139>Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.</A><br>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech24><b>Shepherd</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=140>'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.</A><br>
<p><i>Exeunt</i></p>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=141>SCENE I:</A><br>
<p><i>Enter Time, the Chorus</i></p>
</blockquote>

<A NAME=speech25><b>Time</b></a>
<blockquote>
<A NAME=142>I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror</A><br>
<A NAME=143>Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,</A><br>
<A NAME=144>Now take upon me, in the name of Time,</A><br>
<A NAME=145>To use my wings. Impute it not a crime</A><br>
<A NAME=146>To me or my swift passage, that I slide</A><br>
<A NAME=147>O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried</A><br>
<A NAME=148>Of that wide gap, since it is in my power</A><br>
<A NAME=149>To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour</A><br>
<A NAME=150>To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass</A><br>
<A NAME=151>The same I am, ere ancient'st order was</A><br>
<A NAME=152>Or what is now received: I witness to</A><br>
<A NAME=153>The times that brought them in; so shall I do</A><br>
<A NAME=154>To the freshest things now reigning and make stale</A><br>
<A NAME=155>The glistering of this present, as my tale</A><br>
<A NAME=156>Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,</A><br>
<A NAME=157>I turn my glass and give my scene such growing</A><br>
<A NAME=158>As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,</A><br>
<A NAME=159>The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving</A><br>
<A NAME=160>That he shuts up himself, imagine me,</A><br>
<A NAME=161>Gentle spectators, that I now may be</A><br>
<A NAME=162>In fair Bohemia, and remember well,</A><br>
<A NAME=163>I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel</A><br>
<A NAME=164>I now name to you; and with speed so pace</A><br>
<A NAME=165>To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace</A><br>
<A NAME=166>Equal with wondering: what of her ensues</A><br>
<A NAME=167>I list not prophecy; but let Time's news</A><br>
<A NAME=168>Be known when 'tis brought forth.</A><br>
<A NAME=169>A shepherd's daughter,</A><br>
<A NAME=170>And what to her adheres, which follows after,</A><br>
<A NAME=171>Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,</A><br>
<A NAME=172>If ever you have spent time worse ere now;</A><br>
<A NAME=173>If never, yet that Time himself doth say</A><br>
<A NAME=174>He wishes earnestly you never may.</A><br>
